/**
 * @class   vtkGenericDataSet
 * @brief   defines dataset interface
 *
 * In VTK, spatial-temporal data is defined in terms of a dataset. The
 * dataset consists of geometry (e.g., points), topology (e.g., cells), and
 * attributes (e.g., scalars, vectors, etc.) vtkGenericDataSet is an abstract
 * class defining this abstraction.
 *
 * Since vtkGenericDataSet provides a general interface to manipulate data,
 * algorithms that process it tend to be slower than those specialized for a
 * particular data type. For this reason, there are concrete, non-abstract
 * subclasses that represent and provide access to data more efficiently.
 * Note that filters to process this dataset type are currently found in the
 * VTK/GenericFiltering/ subdirectory.
 *
 * Unlike the vtkDataSet class, vtkGenericDataSet provides a more flexible
 * interface including support for iterators. vtkGenericDataSet is also
 * designed to interface VTK to external simulation packages without the
 * penalty of copying memory (see VTK/GenericFiltering/README.html) for
 * more information. Thus vtkGenericDataSet plays a central role in the
 * adaptor framework.
 *
 * Please note that this class introduces the concepts of "boundary cells".
 * This refers to the boundaries of a cell (e.g., face of a tetrahedron)
 * which may in turn be represented as a cell. Boundary cells are derivative
 * topological features of cells, and are therefore never explicitly
 * represented in the dataset. Often in visualization algorithms, looping
 * over boundaries (edges or faces) is employed, while the actual dataset
 * cells may not traversed. Thus there are methods to loop over these
 * boundary cells.
 *
 * Finally, as a point of clarification, points are not the same as vertices.
 * Vertices refer to points, and points specify a position is space. Vertices
 * are a type of 0-D cell. Also, the concept of a DOFNode, which is where
 * coefficients for higher-order cells are kept, is a new concept introduced
 * by the adaptor framework (see vtkGenericAdaptorCell for more information).
