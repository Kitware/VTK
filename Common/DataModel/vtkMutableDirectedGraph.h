 *
 *
 * vtkMutableDirectedGraph is a directed graph which has additional methods
 * for adding edges and vertices. AddChild() is a convenience method for
 * constructing trees. ShallowCopy(), DeepCopy(), CheckedShallowCopy() and
 * CheckedDeepCopy() will succeed for instances of vtkDirectedGraph,
 * vtkMutableDirectedGraph and vtkTree.
