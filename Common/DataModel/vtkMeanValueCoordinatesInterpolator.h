/**
 * @class   vtkMeanValueCoordinatesInterpolator
 * @brief   compute interpolation computes
 * for closed triangular mesh
 *
 * vtkMeanValueCoordinatesInterpolator computes interpolation weights for a
 * closed, manifold polyhedron mesh.  Once computed, the interpolation
 * weights can be used to interpolate data anywhere interior or exterior to
 * the mesh. This work implements two MVC algorithms. The first one is for
 * triangular meshes which is documented in the Siggraph 2005 paper by Tao Ju,
 * Scot Schaefer and Joe Warren from Rice University "Mean Value Coordinates
 * for Closed Triangular Meshes". The second one is for general polyhedron
 * mesh which is documented in the Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing
 * 2006 paper by Torsten Langer, Alexander Belyaev and Hans-Peter Seidel from
 * MPI Informatik "Spherical Barycentric Coordinates".
 * The filter will automatically choose which algorithm to use based on whether
 * the input mesh is triangulated or not.
 *
 * In VTK this class was initially created to interpolate data across
 * polyhedral cells. In addition, the class can be used to interpolate
 * data values from a polyhedron mesh, and to smoothly deform a mesh from
 * an associated control mesh.
