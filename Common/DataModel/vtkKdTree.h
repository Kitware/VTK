/**
 * @class   vtkKdTree
 * @brief   a Kd-tree spatial decomposition of a set of points
 *
 *
 *     Given one or more vtkDataSets, create a load balancing
 *     k-d tree decomposition of the points at the center of the cells.
 *     Or, create a k-d tree point locator from a list of points.
 *
 *     This class can also generate a PolyData representation of
 *     the boundaries of the spatial regions in the decomposition.
 *
 *     It can sort the regions with respect to a viewing direction,
 *     and it can decompose a list of regions into subsets, each
 *     of which represent a convex spatial region (since many algorithms
 *     require a convex region).
 *
 *     If the points were derived from cells, vtkKdTree
 *     can create a list of cell Ids for each region for each data set.
 *     Two lists are available - all cells with centroid in the region,
 *     and all cells that intersect the region but whose centroid lies
 *     in another region.
 *
 *     For the purpose of removing duplicate points quickly from large
 *     data sets, or for finding nearby points, we added another mode for
 *     building the locator.  BuildLocatorFromPoints will build a k-d tree
 *     from one or more vtkPoints objects.  This can be followed by
 *     BuildMapForDuplicatePoints which returns a mapping from the original
 *     ids to a subset of the ids that is unique within a supplied
 *     tolerance, or you can use FindPoint and FindClosestPoint to
 *     locate points in the original set that the tree was built from.
