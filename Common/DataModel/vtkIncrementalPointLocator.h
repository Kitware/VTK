/**
 * @class   vtkIncrementalPointLocator
 * @brief   Abstract class in support of both
 *  point location and point insertion.
 *
 *
 *  Compared to a static point locator for pure location functionalities
 *  through some search structure established from a fixed set of points,
 *  an incremental point locator allows for, in addition, point insertion
 *  capabilities, with the search structure maintaining a dynamically
 *  increasing number of points. There are two incremental point locators,
 *  i.e., vtkPointLocator and vtkIncrementalOctreePointLocator. As opposed
 *  to the uniform bin-based search structure (adopted in vtkPointLocator)
 *  with a fixed spatial resolution, an octree mechanism (employed in
 *  vtkIncrementalOctreePointlocator) resorts to a hierarchy of tree-like
 *  sub-division of the 3D data domain. Thus it enables data-aware multi-
 *  resolution and accordingly accelerated point location as well as point
 *  insertion, particularly when handling a radically imbalanced layout of
 *  points as not uncommon in datasets defined on adaptive meshes. In other
 *  words, vtkIncrementalOctreePointLocator is an octree-based accelerated
 *  implementation of all functionalities of vtkPointLocator.
