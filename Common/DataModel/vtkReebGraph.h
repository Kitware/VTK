 * @class   vtkReebGraph
 * @brief   Reeb graph computation for PL scalar fields.
 *
 *
 * vtkReebGraph is a class that computes a Reeb graph given a PL scalar
 * field (vtkDataArray) defined on a simplicial mesh.
 * A Reeb graph is a concise representation of the connectivity evolution of
 * the level sets of a scalar function.
 *
 * It is particularly useful in visualization (optimal seed set computation,
 * fast flexible isosurface extraction, automated transfer function design,
 * feature-driven visualization, etc.) and computer graphics (shape
 * deformation, shape matching, shape compression, etc.).
 *
 * Reference:
 * "Sur les points singuliers d'une forme de Pfaff completement integrable ou
 * d'une fonction numerique",
 * G. Reeb,
 * Comptes-rendus de l'Academie des Sciences, 222:847-849, 1946.
 *
 * vtkReebGraph implements one of the latest and most robust Reeb graph
 * computation algorithms.
 *
 * Reference:
 * "Robust on-line computation of Reeb graphs: simplicity and speed",
 * V. Pascucci, G. Scorzelli, P.-T. Bremer, and A. Mascarenhas,
 * ACM Transactions on Graphics, Proc. of SIGGRAPH 2007.
 *
 * vtkReebGraph provides methods for computing multi-resolution topological
 * hierarchies through topological simplification.
 * Topoligical simplification can be either driven by persistence homology
 * concepts (default behavior) or by application specific metrics (see
 * vtkReebGraphSimplificationMetric).
 * In the latter case, designing customized simplification metric evaluation
 * algorithms enables the user to control the definition of what should be
 * considered as noise or signal in the topological filtering process.

 *
 *
 *
 * Reeb graphs can be computed from 2D data (vtkPolyData, with triangles only)
 * or 3D data (vtkUnstructuredGrid, with tetrahedra only), sequentially (see
 * the "Build" calls) or in streaming (see the "StreamTriangle" and
 * "StreamTetrahedron" calls).
 *
 * vtkReebGraph inherits from vtkMutableDirectedGraph.
 *
 * Each vertex of a vtkReebGraph object represents a critical point of the
 * scalar field where the connectivity of the related level set changes
 * (creation, deletion, split or merge of connected components).
 * A vtkIdTypeArray (called "Vertex Ids") is associated with the VertexData of
 * a vtkReebGraph object, in order to retrieve if necessary the exact Ids of
 * the corresponding vertices in the input mesh.
 *
 * The edges of a vtkReebGraph object represent the regions of the input mesh
 * separated by the critical contours of the field, and where the connectivity
 * of the input field does not change.
 * A vtkVariantArray is associated with the EdgeDta of a vtkReebGraph object and
 * each entry of this array is a vtkAbstractArray containing the Ids of the
 * vertices of those regions, sorted by function value (useful for flexible
 * isosurface extraction or level set signature computation, for instance).
 *
 * See Graphics/Testing/Cxx/TestReebGraph.cxx for examples of traversals and
 * typical usages (customized simplification, skeletonization, contour spectra,
 *  etc.) of a vtkReebGraph object.

   * Customized simplification metric evaluation algorithm can be designed (see
