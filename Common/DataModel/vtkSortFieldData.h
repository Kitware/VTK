/**
 * @class   vtkSortFieldData
 * @brief   provides a method for sorting field data
 *
 *
 * vtkSortFieldData is used to sort data, based on its value, or with an
 * associated key, into either ascending or descending order. This is useful
 * for operations like selection, or analysis, when evaluating and processing
 * data.
 *
 * This class, which extends the base functionality of vtkSortDataArray,
 * is used to sort field data and its various subclasses (vtkFieldData,
 * vtkDataSetAttributes, vtkPointData, vtkCellData, etc.)
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly on
 * multi-core machines.
 *
 * @warning
 * The sort methods below are static, hence the sorting methods can be
 * used without instantiating the class. All methods are thread safe.
 *

   * it. Note that the indices are in sorted (ascending) order, and indicate
   * the final sorted position of the sort. So for example indices[0]=10
   * indicates that the original data in position 10 in the field, was moved
   * to position 0 after the sort. By default, returnIndices=0. (Other notes:
   * if any array is not the same length as the sorting array, then it will
