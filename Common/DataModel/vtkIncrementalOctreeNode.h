/**
 * @class   vtkIncrementalOctreeNode
 * @brief   Octree node constituting incremental
 *  octree (in support of both point location and point insertion)
 *
 *
 *  Octree nodes serve as spatial sub-division primitives to build the search
 *  structure of an incremental octree in a recursive top-down manner. The
 *  hierarchy takes the form of a tree-like representation by which a parent
 *  node contains eight mutually non-overlapping child nodes. Each child is
 *  assigned with an axis-aligned rectangular volume (Spatial Bounding Box)
 *  and the eight children together cover exactly the same region as governed
 *  by their parent. The eight child nodes / octants are ordered as
 *
 *  { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] & (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] & (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] },
 *  { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] & (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] & (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] },
 *  { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] & (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] & (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] },
 *  { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] & (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] & (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] },
 *  { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] & (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] & (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] },
 *  { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] & (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] & (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] },
 *  { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] & (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] & (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] },
 *  { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] & (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] & (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] },
 *
 *  where { xrange & yRange & zRange } defines the region of each 3D octant.
 *  In addition, the points falling within and registered, by means of point
 *  indices, in the parent node are distributed to the child nodes for delegated
 *  maintenance. In fact, only leaf nodes, i.e., those without any descendants,
 *  actually store point indices while each node, regardless of a leaf or non-
 *  leaf node, keeps a dynamically updated Data Bounding Box of the inhabitant
 *  points, if any. Given a maximum number of points per leaf node, an octree
 *  is initialized with an empty leaf node that is then recursively sub-divided,
 *  but only on demand as points are incrementally inserted, to construct a
 *  populated tree.
 *
 *  Please note that this octree node class is able to handle a large number
 *  of EXACTLY duplicate points that is greater than the specified maximum
 *  number of points per leaf node. In other words, as an exception, a leaf
 *  node may maintain an arbitrary number of exactly duplicate points to deal
 *  with possible extreme cases.
