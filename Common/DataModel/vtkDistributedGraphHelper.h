/**
 * @class   vtkDistributedGraphHelper
 * @brief   helper for the vtkGraph class
 * that allows the graph to be distributed across multiple memory spaces.
 *
 *
 * A distributed graph helper can be attached to an empty vtkGraph
 * object to turn the vtkGraph into a distributed graph, whose
 * vertices and edges are distributed across several different
 * processors. vtkDistributedGraphHelper is an abstract class. Use a
 * subclass of vtkDistributedGraphHelper, such as
 * vtkPBGLDistributedGraphHelper, to build distributed graphs.
 *
 * The distributed graph helper provides facilities used by vtkGraph
 * to communicate with other processors that store other parts of the
 * same distributed graph. The only user-level functionality provided
 * by vtkDistributedGraphHelper involves this communication among
 * processors and the ability to map between "distributed" vertex and
 * edge IDs and their component parts (processor and local index). For
 * example, the Synchronize() method provides a barrier that allows
 * all processors to catch up to the same point in the code before any
 * processor can leave that Synchronize() call. For example, one would
 * call Synchronize() after adding many edges to a distributed graph,
 * so that all processors can handle the addition of inter-processor
 * edges and continue, after the Synchronize() call, with a consistent
 * view of the distributed graph. For more information about
 * manipulating (distributed) graphs, see the vtkGraph documentation.

// across processors in a vtkGraph. The pedigree ID distribution
// function takes the pedigree ID of the vertex and a user-supplied
// void pointer and returns a hash value V. A vertex with that
// pedigree ID will reside on processor V % P, where P is the number
// of processors. This type is used in conjunction with the
// vtkDistributedGraphHelper class.
