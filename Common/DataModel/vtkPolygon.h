 * @class   vtkPolygon
 * @brief   a cell that represents an n-sided polygon
 *
 * vtkPolygon is a concrete implementation of vtkCell to represent a 2D
 * n-sided polygon. The polygons cannot have any internal holes, and cannot
 * self-intersect. Define the polygon with n-points ordered in the counter-
 * clockwise direction; do not repeat the last point.
