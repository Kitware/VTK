 * @class   vtkHyperOctree
 * @brief   A dataset structured as a tree where each node has
 * exactly 2^n children.
 *
 * An hyperoctree is a dataset where each node has either exactly 2^n children
 * or no child at all if the node is a leaf. `n' is the dimension of the
 * dataset (1 (binary tree), 2 (quadtree) or 3 (octree) ).
 * The class name comes from the following paper:
 *
 * \verbatim
 * @ARTICLE{yau-srihari-1983,
 *  author={Mann-May Yau and Sargur N. Srihari},
 *  title={A Hierarchical Data Structure for Multidimensional Digital Images},
 *  journal={Communications of the ACM},
 *  month={July},
 *  year={1983},
 *  volume={26},
 *  number={7},
 *  pages={504--515}
 *  }
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * Each node is a cell. Attributes are associated with cells, not with points.
 * The geometry is implicitly given by the size of the root node on each axis
 * and position of the center and the orientation. (TODO: review center
 * position and orientation). The geometry is then not limited to an hybercube
 * but can have a rectangular shape.
 * Attributes are associated with leaves. For LOD (Level-Of-Detail) purpose,
 * attributes can be computed on none-leaf nodes by computing the average
 * values from its children (which can be leaves or not).
 *
 * By construction, an hyperoctree is efficient in memory usage when the
 * geometry is sparse. The LOD feature allows to cull quickly part of the
 * dataset.
 *
 * A couple of filters can be applied on this dataset: contour, outline,
 * geometry.
 *
 * * 3D case (octree)
 * for each node, each child index (from 0 to 7) is encoded in the following
 * orientation. It is easy to access each child as a cell of a grid.
 * Note also that the binary representation is relevant, each bit code a
 * side: bit 0 encodes -x side (0) or +x side (1)
 * bit 1 encodes -y side (0) or +y side (1)
 * bit 2 encodes -z side (0) or +z side (2)
 * - the -z side first
 * - 0: -y -x sides
 * - 1: -y +x sides
 * - 2: +y -x sides
 * - 3: +y +x sides
 * \verbatim
 *              +y
 * +-+-+        ^
 * |2|3|        |
 * +-+-+  O +z  +-> +x
 * |0|1|
 * +-+-+
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * - then the +z side, in counter-clockwise
 * - 4: -y -x sides
 * - 5: -y +x sides
 * - 6: +y -x sides
 * - 7: +y +x sides
 * \verbatim
 *              +y
 * +-+-+        ^
 * |6|7|        |
 * +-+-+  O +z  +-> +x
 * |4|5|
 * +-+-+
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * The cases with fewer dimensions are consistent with the octree case:
 *
 * * Quadtree:
 * in counter-clockwise
 * - 0: -y -x edges
 * - 1: -y +x edges
 * - 2: +y -x edges
 * - 3: +y +x edges
 * \verbatim
 *         +y
 * +-+-+   ^
 * |2|3|   |
 * +-+-+  O+-> +x
 * |0|1|
 * +-+-+
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * * Binary tree:
 * \verbatim
 * +0+1+  O+-> +x
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * @warning
 * It is not a spatial search object! If you looking for this kind of
 * octree see vtkCellLocator instead.
