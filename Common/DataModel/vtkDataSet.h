/**
 * @class   vtkDataSet
 * @brief   abstract class to specify dataset behavior
 *
 * vtkDataSet is an abstract class that specifies an interface for dataset
 * objects. vtkDataSet also provides methods to provide information about
 * the data, such as center, bounding box, and representative length.
 *
 * In vtk a dataset consists of a structure (geometry and topology) and
 * attribute data. The structure is defined implicitly or explicitly as
 * a collection of cells. The geometry of the structure is contained in
 * point coordinates plus the cell interpolation functions. The topology
 * of the dataset structure is defined by cell types and how the cells
 * share their defining points.
 *
 * Attribute data in vtk is either point data (data at points) or cell data
 * (data at cells). Typically filters operate on point data, but some may
 * operate on cell data, both cell and point data, either one, or none.
