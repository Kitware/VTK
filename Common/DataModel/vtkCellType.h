/**
 * @class   vtkCellType
 * @brief   define types of cells
 *
 * vtkCellType defines the allowable cell types in the visualization
 * library (vtk). In vtk, datasets consist of collections of cells.
 * Different datasets consist of different cell types. The cells may be
 * explicitly represented (as in vtkPolyData), or may be implicit to the
 * data type (as in vtkStructuredPoints).

#ifndef vtkCellType_h
#define vtkCellType_h

// To add a new cell type, define a new integer type flag here, then
// create a subclass of vtkCell to implement the proper behavior. You
// may have to modify the following methods: vtkDataSet (and subclasses)
// GetCell() and vtkGenericCell::SetCellType(). Also, to do the job right,
// you'll also have to modify some filters (vtkGeometryFilter...) and
// regression tests (example scripts) to reflect the new cell addition.
// Also, make sure to update vtkCellTypesStrings in vtkCellTypes.cxx
// and the vtkCellTypes::IsLinear method in vtkCellTypes.h.

// .SECTION Caveats
// An unstructured grid stores the types of its cells as a
// unsigned char array. Therefore, the maximum encoding number for a cell type
// is 255.
