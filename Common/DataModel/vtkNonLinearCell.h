/**
 * @class   vtkNonLinearCell
 * @brief   abstract superclass for non-linear cells
 *
 * vtkNonLinearCell is an abstract superclass for non-linear cell types.
 * Cells that are a direct subclass of vtkCell or vtkCell3D are linear;
 * cells that are a subclass of vtkNonLinearCell have non-linear interpolation
 * functions. Non-linear cells require special treatment when tessellating
 * or converting to graphics primitives. Note that the linearity of the cell
 * is a function of whether the cell needs tessellation, which does not
 * strictly correlate with interpolation order (e.g., vtkHexahedron has
 * non-linear interpolation functions (a product of three linear functions
 * in r-s-t) even thought vtkHexahedron is considered linear.)
