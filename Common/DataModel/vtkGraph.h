/**
 * @class   vtkGraph
 * @brief   Base class for graph data types.
 *
 *
 * vtkGraph is the abstract base class that provides all read-only API for graph
 * data types. A graph consists of a collection of vertices and a
 * collection of edges connecting pairs of vertices. The vtkDirectedGraph
 * subclass represents a graph whose edges have inherent order from source
 * vertex to target vertex, while vtkUndirectedGraph is a graph whose edges
 * have no inherent ordering.
 *
 * Graph vertices may be traversed in two ways. In the current implementation,
 * all vertices are assigned consecutive ids starting at zero, so they may
 * be traversed in a simple for loop from 0 to graph->GetNumberOfVertices() - 1.
 * You may alternately create a vtkVertexListIterator and call graph->GetVertices(it).
 * it->Next() will return the id of the next vertex, while it->HasNext() indicates
 * whether there are more vertices in the graph.
 * This is the preferred method, since in the future graphs may support filtering
 * or subsetting where the vertex ids may not be contiguous.
 *
 * Graph edges must be traversed through iterators. To traverse all edges
 * in a graph, create an instance of vtkEdgeListIterator and call graph->GetEdges(it).
 * it->Next() returns lightweight vtkEdgeType structures, which contain the public
 * fields Id, Source and Target. Id is the identifier for the edge, which may
 * be used to look up values in assiciated edge data arrays. Source and Target
 * store the ids of the source and target vertices of the edge. Note that the
 * edge list iterator DOES NOT necessarily iterate over edges in order of ascending
 * id. To traverse edges from wrapper code (Python, Tcl, Java), use
 * it->NextGraphEdge() instead of it->Next().  This will return a heavyweight,
 * wrappable vtkGraphEdge object, which has the same fields as vtkEdgeType
 * accessible through getter methods.
 *
 * To traverse all edges outgoing from a vertex, create a vtkOutEdgeIterator and
 * call graph->GetOutEdges(v, it). it->Next() returns a lightweight vtkOutEdgeType
 * containing the fields Id and Target. The source of the edge is always the
 * vertex that was passed as an argument to GetOutEdges().
 * Incoming edges may be similarly traversed with vtkInEdgeIterator, which returns
 * vtkInEdgeType structures with Id and Source fields.
 * Both vtkOutEdgeIterator and vtkInEdgeIterator also provide the wrapper functions
 * NextGraphEdge() which return vtkGraphEdge objects.
 *
 * An additional iterator, vtkAdjacentVertexIterator can traverse outgoing vertices
 * directly, instead needing to parse through edges. Initialize the iterator by
 * calling graph->GetAdjacentVertices(v, it).
 *
 * vtkGraph has two instances of vtkDataSetAttributes for associated
 * vertex and edge data. It also has a vtkPoints instance which may store
 * x,y,z locations for each vertex. This is populated by filters such as
 * vtkGraphLayout and vtkAssignCoordinates.
 *
 * All graph types share the same implementation, so the structure of one
 * may be shared among multiple graphs, even graphs of different types.
 * Structures from vtkUndirectedGraph and vtkMutableUndirectedGraph may be
 * shared directly.  Structures from vtkDirectedGraph, vtkMutableDirectedGraph,
 * and vtkTree may be shared directly with the exception that setting a
 * structure to a tree requires that a "is a tree" test passes.
 *
 * For graph types that are known to be compatible, calling ShallowCopy()
 * or DeepCopy() will work as expected.  When the outcome of a conversion
 * is unknown (i.e. setting a graph to a tree), CheckedShallowCopy() and
 * CheckedDeepCopy() exist which are identical to ShallowCopy() and DeepCopy(),
 * except that instead of emitting an error for an incompatible structure,
 * the function returns false.  This allows you to programmatically check
 * structure compatibility without causing error messages.
 *
 * To construct a graph, use vtkMutableDirectedGraph or
 * vtkMutableUndirectedGraph. You may then use CheckedShallowCopy
 * to set the contents of a mutable graph type into one of the non-mutable
 * types vtkDirectedGraph, vtkUndirectedGraph.
 * To construct a tree, use vtkMutableDirectedGraph, with directed edges
 * which point from the parent to the child, then use CheckedShallowCopy
 * to set the structure to a vtkTree.
 *
 * @warning
 * All copy operations implement copy-on-write. The structures are initially
 * shared, but if one of the graphs is modified, the structure is copied
 * so that to the user they function as if they were deep copied. This means
 * that care must be taken if different threads are accessing different graph
 * instances that share the same structure. Race conditions may develop if
 * one thread is modifying the graph at the same time that another graph is
 * copying the structure.
 *
 * @par Vertex pedigree IDs:
 * The vertices in a vtkGraph can be associated with pedigree IDs
 * through GetVertexData()->SetPedigreeIds. In this case, there is a
 * 1-1 mapping between pedigree Ids and vertices. One can query the
 * vertex ID based on the pedigree ID using FindVertex, add new
 * vertices by pedigree ID with AddVertex, and add edges based on the
 * pedigree IDs of the source and target vertices. For example,
 * AddEdge("Here", "There") will find (or add) vertices with pedigree
 * ID "Here" and "There" and then introduce an edge from "Here" to
 * "There".
 *
 * @par Vertex pedigree IDs:
 * To configure the vtkGraph with a pedigree ID mapping, create a
 * vtkDataArray that will store the pedigree IDs and set that array as
 * the pedigree ID array for the vertices via
 * GetVertexData()->SetPedigreeIds().
 *
 *
 * @par Distributed graphs:
 * vtkGraph instances can be distributed across multiple machines, to
 * allow the construction and manipulation of graphs larger than a
 * single machine could handle. A distributed graph will typically be
 * distributed across many different nodes within a cluster, using the
 * Message Passing Interface (MPI) to allow those cluster nodes to
 * communicate.
 *
 * @par Distributed graphs:
 * An empty vtkGraph can be made into a distributed graph by attaching
 * an instance of a vtkDistributedGraphHelper via the
 * SetDistributedGraphHelper() method. To determine whether a graph is
 * distributed or not, call GetDistributedGraphHelper() and check
 * whether the result is non-NULL. For a distributed graph, the number
 * of processors across which the graph is distributed can be
 * retrieved by extracting the value for the DATA_NUMBER_OF_PIECES key
 * in the vtkInformation object (retrieved by GetInformation())
 * associated with the graph. Similarly, the value corresponding to
 * the DATA_PIECE_NUMBER key of the vtkInformation object describes
 * which piece of the data this graph instance provides.
 *
 * @par Distributed graphs:
 * Distributed graphs behave somewhat differently from non-distributed
 * graphs, and will require special care. In a distributed graph, each
 * of the processors will contain a subset of the vertices in the
 * graph. That subset of vertices can be accessed via the
 * vtkVertexListIterator produced by GetVertices().
 * GetNumberOfVertices(), therefore, returns the number of vertices
 * stored locally: it does not account for vertices stored on other
 * processors. A vertex (or edge) is identified by both the rank of
 * its owning processor and by its index within that processor, both
 * of which are encoded within the vtkIdType value that describes that
 * vertex (or edge). The owning processor is a value between 0 and
 * P-1, where P is the number of processors across which the vtkGraph
 * has been distributed. The local index will be a value between 0 and
 * GetNumberOfVertices(), for vertices, or GetNumberOfEdges(), for
 * edges, and can be used to access the local parts of distributed
 * data arrays. When given a vtkIdType identifying a vertex, one can
 * determine the owner of the vertex with
 * vtkDistributedGraphHelper::GetVertexOwner() and the local index
 * with vtkDistributedGraphHelper::GetVertexIndex(). With edges, the
 * appropriate methods are vtkDistributedGraphHelper::GetEdgeOwner()
 * and vtkDistributedGraphHelper::GetEdgeIndex(), respectively. To
 * construct a vtkIdType representing either a vertex or edge given
 * only its owner and local index, use
 * vtkDistributedGraphHelper::MakeDistributedId().
 *
 * @par Distributed graphs:
 * The edges in a distributed graph are always stored on the
 * processors that own the vertices named by the edge. For example,
 * given a directed edge (u, v), the edge will be stored in the
 * out-edges list for vertex u on the processor that owns u, and in
 * the in-edges list for vertex v on the processor that owns v. This
 * "row-wise" decomposition of the graph means that, for any vertex
 * that is local to a processor, that processor can look at all of the
 * incoming and outgoing edges of the graph. Processors cannot,
 * however, access the incoming or outgoing edge lists of vertex owned
 * by other processors. Vertices owned by other processors will not be
 * encountered when traversing the vertex list via GetVertices(), but
 * may be encountered by traversing the in- and out-edge lists of
 * local vertices or the edge list.
 *
 * @par Distributed graphs:
 * Distributed graphs can have pedigree IDs for the vertices in the
 * same way that non-distributed graphs can. In this case, the
 * distribution of the vertices in the graph is based on pedigree
 * ID. For example, a vertex with the pedigree ID "Here" might land on
 * processor 0 while a vertex pedigree ID "There" would end up on
 * processor 3. By default, the pedigree IDs themselves are hashed to
 * give a random (and, hopefully, even) distribution of the
 * vertices. However, one can provide a different vertex distribution
 * function by calling
 * vtkDistributedGraphHelper::SetVertexPedigreeIdDistribution.  Once a
 * distributed graph has pedigree IDs, the no-argument AddVertex()
 * method can no longer be used. Additionally, once a vertex has a
 * pedigree ID, that pedigree ID should not be changed unless the user
 * can guarantee that the vertex distribution will still map that
 * vertex to the same processor where it already resides.
