/**
 * @class   vtkOctreePointLocatorNode
 * @brief   Octree node that has 8 children each of equal size
 *
 *
 * This class represents a single spatial region in a 3D axis octant
 * partitioning.  It is intended to work efficiently with the
 * vtkOctreePointLocator and is not meant for general use.  It is assumed
 * the region bounds some set of points.  The ordering of the children is
 * (-x,-y,-z),(+x,-y,-z),(-x,+y,-z),(+x,+y,-z),(-x,-y,+z),(+x,-y,+z),
 * (-x,+y,+z),(+x,+y,+z).  The portion of the domain assigned to an
 * octant is Min < x <= Max.
