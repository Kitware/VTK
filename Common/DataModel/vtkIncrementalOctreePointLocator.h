/**
 * @class   vtkIncrementalOctreePointLocator
 * @brief   Incremental octree in support
 *  of both point location and point insertion.
 *
 *
 *  As opposed to the uniform bin-based search structure (adopted in class
 *  vtkPointLocator) with a fixed spatial resolution, an octree mechanism
 *  employs a hierarchy of tree-like sub-division of the 3D data domain. Thus
 *  it enables data-aware multi-resolution and accordingly accelerated point
 *  location as well as insertion, particularly when handling a radically
 *  imbalanced layout of points as not uncommon in datasets defined on
 *  adaptive meshes. Compared to a static point locator supporting pure
 *  location functionalities through some search structure established from
 *  a fixed set of points, an incremental point locator allows for, in addition,
 *  point insertion capabilities, with the search structure maintaining a
 *  dynamically increasing number of points.
 *  Class vtkIncrementalOctreePointLocator is an octree-based accelerated
 *  implementation of the functionalities of the uniform bin-based incremental
 *  point locator vtkPointLocator. For point location, an octree is built by
 *  accessing a vtkDataSet, specifically a vtkPointSet. For point insertion,
 *  an empty octree is inited and then incrementally populated as points are
 *  inserted. Three increasingly complex point insertion modes, i.e., direct
 *  check-free insertion, zero tolerance insertion, and non-zero tolerance
 *  insertion, are supported. In fact, the octree used in the point location
 *  mode is actually constructed via direct check-free point insertion. This
 *  class also provides a polygonal representation of the octree boundary.
