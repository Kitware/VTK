 * @class   vtkAbstractPointLocator
 * @brief   abstract class to quickly locate points in 3-space
 *
 * vtkAbstractPointLocator is an abstract spatial search object to quickly locate points
 * in 3D. vtkAbstractPointLocator works by dividing a specified region of space into
 * "rectangular" buckets, and then keeping a list of points that
 * lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving a position in 3D
 * and finding the closest point.  The points are provided from the specified
 * dataset input.
