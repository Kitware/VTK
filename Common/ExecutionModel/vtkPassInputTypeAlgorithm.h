/**
 * @class   vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm
 * @brief   Superclass for algorithms that produce output of the same type as input
 *
 * vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm is a convenience class to make writing algorithms
 * easier. It is also designed to help transition old algorithms to the new
 * pipeline architecture. There are some assumptions and defaults made by this
 * class you should be aware of. This class defaults such that your filter
 * will have one input port and one output port. If that is not the case
 * simply change it with SetNumberOfInputPorts etc. See this classes
 * contstructor for the default. This class also provides a FillInputPortInfo
 * method that by default says that all inputs will be DataObject. If that isn't
 * the case then please override this method in your subclass. This class
 * breaks out the downstream requests into separate functions such as
 * RequestDataObject RequestData and RequestInformation. The default
 * implementation of RequestDataObject will create an output data of the
 * same type as the input.
