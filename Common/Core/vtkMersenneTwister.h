/**
 * @class   vtkMersenneTwister
 * @brief   Generator for Mersenne Twister pseudorandom numbers
 *
 * vtkMersenneTwister is an implementation of the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom
 * number generator. The VTK class is simply a wrapper around an implementation
 * written by M. Matsumoto, T. Nishimura and M. Saito, whose source code can be
 * found at http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/DC/dc.html.
 *
 * This implementation of the Mersenne Twister facilitates the generation and
 * query from multiple independent pseudorandom sequences. Independent sequences
 * are identified by a unique vtkMersenneTwister::SequenceId, which is either
 * generated upon request or passed into the initialization method. This id is
 * factored into the initialization of the Mersenne Twister's initial state, so
 * two sequences with the same seed and different sequence ids will produce
 * different results. Once a sequence is initialized with an associated sequence
 * id, this id is used to obtain values from the sequence.
