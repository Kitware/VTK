/**
 * @class   vtkAnimationCue
 * @brief   a seqin an animation.
 *
 * vtkAnimationCue and vtkAnimationScene provide the framework to support
 * animations in VTK. vtkAnimationCue represents an entity that changes/
 * animates with time, while vtkAnimationScene represents scene or setup
 * for the animation, which consists on individual cues or other scenes.
 *
 * A cue has three states: UNINITIALIZED, ACTIVE and INACTIVE.
 * UNINITIALIZED represents an point in time before the start time of the cue.
 * The cue is in ACTIVE state at a point in time between start time and end time
 * for the cue. While, beyond the end time, it is in INACTIVE state.
 * When the cue enters the ACTIVE state, StartAnimationCueEvent is fired. This
 * event may be handled to initialize the entity to be animated.
 * When the cue leaves the ACTIVE state, EndAnimationCueEvent is fired, which
 * can be handled to cleanup after having run the animation.
 * For every request to render during the ACTIVE state, AnimationCueTickEvent is
 * fired, which must be handled to perform the actual animation.
