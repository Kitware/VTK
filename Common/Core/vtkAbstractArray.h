/**
 * @class   vtkAbstractArray
 * @brief   Abstract superclass for all arrays
 *
 *
 *
 * vtkAbstractArray is an abstract superclass for data array objects.
 * This class defines an API that all subclasses must support.  The
 * data type must be assignable and copy-constructible, but no other
 * assumptions about its type are made.  Most of the subclasses of
 * this array deal with numeric data either as scalars or tuples of
 * scalars.  A program can use the IsNumeric() method to check whether
 * an instance of vtkAbstractArray contains numbers.  It is also
 * possible to test for this by attempting to SafeDownCast an array to
 * an instance of vtkDataArray, although this assumes that all numeric
 * arrays will always be descended from vtkDataArray.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Every array has a character-string name. The naming of the array
 * occurs automatically when it is instantiated, but you are free to
 * change this name using the SetName() method.  (The array name is
 * used for data manipulation.)
 *
 * This class (and subclasses) use two forms of addressing elements:
 * - Value Indexing: The index of an element assuming an array-of-structs
 *   memory layout.
 * - Tuple/Component Indexing: Explicitly specify the tuple and component
 *   indices.
 *
 * It is also worth pointing out that the behavior of the "Insert*" methods
 * of classes in this hierarchy may not behave as expected. They work exactly
 * as the corresponding "Set*" methods, except that memory allocation will
 * be performed if acting on a value past the end of the array. If the data
 * already exists, "inserting" will overwrite existing values, rather than shift
 * the array contents and insert the new data at the specified location.

   * is assumed to be continuous in nature and no values are returned.

   * This method takes 2 parameters: \a uncertainty and \a minimumProminence.
   * Note that this set of returned values may not be complete if
   * \a uncertainty and \a minimumProminence are both larger than 0.0;
   * in order to perform interactively, a subsample of the array is
   * used to determine the set of values.

   * The first parameter (\a uncertainty, U) is the maximum acceptable
   * probability that a prominent value will not be detected.
   * Setting this to 0 will cause every value in the array to be examined.

   * The second parameter (\a minimumProminence, P) specifies the smallest
   * relative frequency (in [0,1]) with which a value in the array may
   * occur and still be considered prominent. Setting this to 0
   * will force every value in the array to be traversed.
   * Using numbers close to 0 for this parameter quickly causes
   * the number of samples required to obtain the given uncertainty to
   * subsume the entire array, as rare occurrences require frequent
   * sampling to detect.

   * For an array with T tuples and given uncertainty U and mininumum
   * prominence P, we sample N values, with N = f(T; P, U).
   * We want f to be sublinear in T in order to interactively handle large
   * arrays; in practice, we can make f independent of T:
   * \f$ N >= \frac{5}{P}\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{1}{PU}\right) \f$,
   * but note that small values of P are costly to achieve.
   * The default parameters will locate prominent values that occur at least
   * 1 out of every 1000 samples with a confidence of 0.999999 (= 1 - 1e6).
   * Thanks to Seshadri Comandur (Sandia National Laboratories) for the
   * bounds on the number of samples.

   * the array's MTime is newer than the associated vtkInformation object or
   * if better sampling (lower \a uncertainty or \a minimumProminence) is
   * requested.
   * The DISCRETE_VALUE_SAMPLE_PARAMETERS() information key is used to
   * store the numbers which produced any current set of prominent values.

   * Also, note that every value encountered is reported and counts toward
   * the maximum of 32 distinct values, regardless of the value's frequency.
   * This is required for an efficient implementation.
   * Use the vtkOrderStatistics filter if you wish to threshold the set of
