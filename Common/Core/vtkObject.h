/**
 * @class   vtkObject
 * @brief   abstract base class for most VTK objects
 *
 * vtkObject is the base class for most objects in the visualization
 * toolkit. vtkObject provides methods for tracking modification time,
 * debugging, printing, and event callbacks. Most objects created
 * within the VTK framework should be a subclass of vtkObject or one
 * of its children.  The few exceptions tend to be very small helper
 * classes that usually never get instantiated or situations where
 * multiple inheritance gets in the way.  vtkObject also performs
 * reference counting: objects that are reference counted exist as
 * long as another object uses them. Once the last reference to a
 * reference counted object is removed, the object will spontaneously
 * destruct.
 *
 * @warning
 * Note: in VTK objects should always be created with the New() method
 * and deleted with the Delete() method. VTK objects cannot be
 * allocated off the stack (i.e., automatic objects) because the
 * constructor is a protected method.
