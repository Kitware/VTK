// .NAME vtkCutter - Cut vtkDataSet with user-specified implicit function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCutter is a filter to cut through data using any subclass of 
// vtkImplicitFunction. That is, a polygonal surface is created
// corresponding to the implicit function F(x,y,z) = 0.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImplicitFunction
