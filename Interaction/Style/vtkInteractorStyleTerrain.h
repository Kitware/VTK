/**
 * @class   vtkInteractorStyleTerrain
 * @brief   manipulate camera in scene with natural view up (e.g., terrain)
 *
 * vtkInteractorStyleTerrain is used to manipulate a camera which is viewing
 * a scene with a natural view up, e.g., terrain. The camera in such a
 * scene is manipulated by specifying azimuth (angle around the view
 * up vector) and elevation (the angle from the horizon).
 *
 * The mouse binding for this class is as follows. Left mouse click followed
 * rotates the camera around the focal point using both elevation and azimuth
 * invocations on the camera. Left mouse motion in the horizontal direction
 * results in azimuth motion; left mouse motion in the vertical direction
 * results in elevation motion. Therefore, diagonal motion results in a
 * combination of azimuth and elevation. (If the shift key is held during
 * motion, then only one of elevation or azimuth is invoked, depending on the
 * whether the mouse motion is primarily horizontal or vertical.) Middle
 * mouse button pans the camera across the scene (again the shift key has a
 * similar effect on limiting the motion to the vertical or horizontal
 * direction. The right mouse is used to dolly (e.g., a type of zoom) towards
 * or away from the focal point.
 *
 * The class also supports some keypress events. The "r" key resets the
 * camera.  The "e" key invokes the exit callback and by default exits the
 * program. The "f" key sets a new camera focal point and flys towards that
 * point. The "u" key invokes the user event. The "3" key toggles between
 * stereo and non-stero mode. The "l" key toggles on/off a latitude/longitude
 * markers that can be used to estimate/control position.
