/**
 * @class   vtkInteractorStyleUnicam
 * @brief   provides Unicam navigation style
 *
 * UniCam is a camera interactor.  Here, just the primary features of the
 * UniCam technique are implemented.  UniCam requires just one mouse button
 * and supports context sensitive dollying, panning, and rotation.  (In this
 * implementation, it uses the right mouse button, leaving the middle and
 * left available for other functions.) For more information, see the paper
 * at:
 *
 *    ftp://ftp.cs.brown.edu/pub/papers/graphics/research/unicam.pdf
 *
 * The following is a brief description of the UniCam Camera Controls.  You
 * can perform 3 operations on the camera: rotate, pan, and dolly the camera.
 * All operations are reached through the right mouse button & mouse
 * movements.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: UniCam assumes there is an axis that makes sense as a "up"
 * vector for the world.  By default, this axis is defined to be the
 * vector <0,0,1>.  You can set it explicitly for the data you are
 * viewing with the 'SetWorldUpVector(..)' method in C++, or similarly
 * in Tcl/Tk (or other interpreted languages).
 *
 * 1. ROTATE:
 *
 * Position the cursor over the point you wish to rotate around and press and
 * release the left mouse button.  A 'focus dot' appears indicating the
 * point that will be the center of rotation.  To rotate, press and hold the
 * left mouse button and drag the mouse.. release the button to complete the
 * rotation.
 *
 * Rotations can be done without placing a focus dot first by moving the
 * mouse cursor to within 10% of the window border & pressing and holding the
 * left button followed by dragging the mouse.  The last focus dot position
 * will be re-used.
 *
 * 2. PAN:
 *
 * Click and hold the left mouse button, and initially move the mouse left
 * or right.  The point under the initial pick will pick correlate w/ the
 * mouse tip-- (i.e., direct manipulation).
 *
 * 3. DOLLY (+ PAN):
 *
 * Click and hold the left mouse button, and initially move the mouse up or
 * down.  Moving the mouse down will dolly towards the picked point, and moving
 * the mouse up will dolly away from it.  Dollying occurs relative to the
 * picked point which simplifies the task of dollying towards a region of
 * interest. Left and right mouse movements will pan the camera left and right.
 *
 * @warning
 * (NOTE: This implementation of Unicam assumes a perspective camera.  It
 * could be modified relatively easily to also support an orthographic
 * projection.)
