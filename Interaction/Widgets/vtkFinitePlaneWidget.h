/**
 * @class   vtkFinitePlaneWidget
 * @brief   3D widget for manipulating a finite plane
 *
 * This 3D widget interacts with a vtkFinitePlaneRepresentation class (i.e., it
 * handles the events that drive its corresponding representation). This 3D
 * widget defines a finite plane that can be interactively placed in a scene.
 * The widget is assumed to consist of four parts: 1) a plane with 2) a normal
 * and 3) three handles that can be moused on and manipulated.
 * The green and red handles represent the semi finite plane definition,
 * the third is in the center of the plane.
 * Operation like rotation of the plane (using normal), origin translation and
 * geometry plane modification using green and red handles are availables.
 *
 * To use this widget, you generally pair it with a vtkFinitePlaneRepresentation
 * (or a subclass). Various options are available in the representation for
 * controlling how the widget appears, and how the widget reacts.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 * If one of the 3 handles are selected:
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - select the appropriate handle
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the currently selected handle
 *   MouseMoveEvent - move the handle
 * In all the cases, independent of what is picked, the widget responds to the
 * following VTK events:
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - start select action
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - stop select action
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkFinitePlaneWidget's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Select -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- a request for motion has been invoked
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * In turn, when these widget events are processed, the vtkFinitePlaneWidget
 * invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Select)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Move)
 * </pre>
 * @sa
 * vtkFinitePlaneRepresentation
