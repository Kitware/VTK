/**
 * @class   vtkAngleWidget
 * @brief   measure the angle between two rays (defined by three points)
 *
 * The vtkAngleWidget is used to measure the angle between two rays (defined
 * by three points). The three points (two end points and a center)
 * can be positioned independently, and when they are released, a special
 * PlacePointEvent is invoked so that special operations may be take to
 * reposition the point (snap to grid, etc.) The widget has two different
 * modes of interaction: when initially defined (i.e., placing the three
 * points) and then a manipulate mode (adjusting the position of the
 * three points).
 *
 * To use this widget, specify an instance of vtkAngleWidget and a
 * representation (a subclass of vtkAngleRepresentation). The widget is
 * implemented using three instances of vtkHandleWidget which are used to
 * position the three points. The representations for these handle widgets
 * are provided by the vtkAngleRepresentation.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - add a point or select a handle
 *   MouseMoveEvent - position the second or third point, or move a handle
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the selected handle
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkAngleWidget's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::AddPoint -- add one point; depending on the state
 *                               it may the first, second or third point
 *                               added. Or, if near a handle, select the handle.
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- position the second or third point, or move the
 *                           handle depending on the state.
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the handle manipulation process has completed.
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * This widget invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers
 * can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (beginning to interact)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (completing interaction)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (moving a handle)
 *   vtkCommand::PlacePointEvent (after a point is positioned;
 *                                call data includes handle id (0,1,2))
 * </pre>
