/**
 * @class   vtkSphereWidget2
 * @brief   3D widget for manipulating a point on a sphere
 *
 * This 3D widget interacts with a vtkSphereRepresentation class (i.e., it
 * handles the events that drive its corresponding representation). It can be
 * used to position a point on a sphere (for example, to place a light or
 * camera), or to position a sphere in a scene, including translating and
 * scaling the sphere.
 *
 * A nice feature of vtkSphereWidget2, like any 3D widget, is that it will
 * work in combination with the current interactor style (or any other
 * interactor observer). That is, if vtkSphereWidget2 does not handle an
 * event, then all other registered observers (including the interactor
 * style) have an opportunity to process the event. Otherwise, the
 * vtkSphereWidget2 will terminate the processing of the event that it
 * handles.
 *
 * To use this widget, you generally pair it with a vtkSphereRepresentation
 * (or a subclass). Variuos options are available in the representation for
 * controlling how the widget appears, and how the widget functions.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 * If the handle or sphere are selected:
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - select the handle or sphere
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the handle ot sphere
 *   MouseMoveEvent - move the handle or translate the sphere
 * In all the cases, independent of what is picked, the widget responds to the
 * following VTK events:
 *   MiddleButtonPressEvent - translate the representation
 *   MiddleButtonReleaseEvent - stop translating the representation
 *   RightButtonPressEvent - scale the widget's representation
 *   RightButtonReleaseEvent - stop scaling the representation
 *   MouseMoveEvent - scale (if right button) or move (if middle button) the widget
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkSphereWidget2's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Select -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Scale -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndScale -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Translate -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndTranslate -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- a request for motion has been invoked
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * In turn, when these widget events are processed, the vtkSphereWidget2
 * invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Select)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Move)
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * This class, and the affiliated vtkSphereRepresentation, are second generation
 * VTK widgets. An earlier version of this functionality was defined in the
 * class vtkSphereWidget.
