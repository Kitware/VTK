/**
 * @class   vtk3DWidget
 * @brief   an abstract superclass for 3D widgets
 *
 * vtk3DWidget is an abstract superclass for 3D interactor observers. These
 * 3D widgets represent themselves in the scene, and have special callbacks
 * associated with them that allows interactive manipulation of the widget.
 * Inparticular, the difference between a vtk3DWidget and its abstract
 * superclass vtkInteractorObserver is that vtk3DWidgets are "placed" in 3D
 * space.  vtkInteractorObservers have no notion of where they are placed,
 * and may not exist in 3D space at all.  3D widgets also provide auxiliary
 * functions like producing a transformation, creating polydata (for seeding
 * streamlines, probes, etc.) or creating implicit functions. See the
 * concrete subclasses for particulars.
 *
 * Typically the widget is used by specifying a vtkProp3D or VTK dataset as
 * input, and then invoking the "On" method to activate it. (You can also
 * specify a bounding box to help position the widget.) Prior to invoking the
 * On() method, the user may also wish to use the PlaceWidget() to initially
 * position it. The 'i' (for "interactor") keypresses also can be used to
 * turn the widgets on and off (methods exist to change the key value
 * and enable keypress activiation).
 *
 * To support interactive manipulation of objects, this class (and
 * subclasses) invoke the events StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and
 * EndInteractionEvent.  These events are invoked when the vtk3DWidget enters
 * a state where rapid response is desired: mouse motion, etc. The events can
 * be used, for example, to set the desired update frame rate
 * (StartInteractionEvent), operate on the vtkProp3D or other object
 * (InteractionEvent), and set the desired frame rate back to normal values
 * (EndInteractionEvent).
 *
 * Note that the Priority attribute inherited from vtkInteractorObserver has
 * a new default value which is now 0.5 so that all 3D widgets have a higher
 * priority than the usual interactor styles.
