/**
 * @class   vtkAbstractWidget
 * @brief   define the API for widget / widget representation
 *
 * The vtkAbstractWidget defines an API and implements methods common to all
 * widgets using the interaction/representation design. In this design, the
 * term interaction means that part of the widget that performs event
 * handling, while the representation corresponds to a vtkProp (or the
 * subclass vtkWidgetRepresentation) used to represent the
 * widget. vtkAbstractWidget also implements some methods common to all
 * subclasses.
 *
 * Note that vtkAbstractWidget provides access to the
 * vtkWidgetEventTranslator.  This class is responsible for translating VTK
 * events (defined in vtkCommand.h) into widget events (defined in
 * vtkWidgetEvent.h). This class can be manipulated so that different VTK
 * events can be mapped into widget events, thereby allowing the modification
 * of event bindings. Each subclass of vtkAbstractWidget defines the events
 * to which it responds.
 *
 * @warning
 * Note that the pair ( vtkAbstractWidget / vtkWidgetRepresentation ) is an
 * implementation of the second generation VTK Widgets design. In the first
 * generation design, widgets were implemented in a single monolithic
 * class. This design was problematic because in client-server application
 * it was difficult to manage widgets properly. Also, new "representations"
 * or look-and-feel, for a widget required a whole new class, with a lot of
 * redundant code. The separation of the widget event handling and
 * representation enables users and developers to create new appearances for
 * the widget. It also facilitates parallel processing, where the client
 * application handles events, and remote representations of the widget are
 * slaves to the client (and do not handle events).
