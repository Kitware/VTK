/**
 * @class   vtkSplineRepresentation
 * @brief   representation for a spline.
 *
 * vtkSplineRepresentation is a vtkWidgetRepresentation for a spline.
 * This 3D widget defines a spline that can be interactively placed in a
 * scene. The spline has handles, the number of which can be changed, plus it
 * can be picked on the spline itself to translate or rotate it in the scene.
 * This is based on vtkSplineWidget.
