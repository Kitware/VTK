/**
 * @class   vtkContourWidget
 * @brief   create a contour with a set of points
 *
 * The vtkContourWidget is used to select a set of points, and draw lines
 * between these points. The contour may be opened or closed, depending on
 * how the last point is added. The widget handles all processing of widget
 * events (that are triggered by VTK events). The vtkContourRepresentation is
 * responsible for all placement of the points, calculation of the lines, and
 * contour manipulation. This is done through two main helper classes:
 * vtkPointPlacer and vtkContourLineInterpolator. The representation is also
 * responsible for drawing the points and lines.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - triggers a Select event
 *   RightButtonPressEvent - triggers a AddFinalPoint event
 *   MouseMoveEvent - triggers a Move event
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - triggers an EndSelect event
 *   Delete key event - triggers a Delete event
 *   Shift + Delete key event - triggers a Reset event
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkContourWidget's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Select
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start or
 *            Define: If we already have at least 2 nodes, test
 *                 whether the current (X,Y) location is near an existing
 *                 node. If so, close the contour and change to Manipulate
 *                 state. Otherwise, attempt to add a node at this (X,Y)
 *                 location.
 *            Manipulate: If this (X,Y) location activates a node, then
 *                 set the current operation to Translate. Otherwise, if
 *                 this location is near the contour, attempt to add a
 *                 new node on the contour at this (X,Y) location.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::AddFinalPoint
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start: Do nothing.
 *            Define: If we already have at least 2 nodes, test
 *                 whether the current (X,Y) location is near an existing
 *                 node. If so, close the contour and change to Manipulate
 *                 state. Otherwise, attempt to add a node at this (X,Y)
 *                 location. If we do, then leave the contour open and
 *                 change to Manipulate state.
 *            Manipulate: Do nothing.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start or
 *            Define: Do nothing.
 *            Manipulate: If our operation is Translate, then invoke
 *                  WidgetInteraction() on the representation. If our
 *                  operation is Inactive, then just attempt to activate
 *                  a node at this (X,Y) location.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start or
 *            Define: Do nothing.
 *            Manipulate: If our operation is not Inactive, set it to
 *                  Inactive.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Delete
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start: Do nothing.
 *            Define: Remove the last point on the contour.
 *            Manipulate: Attempt to activate a node at (X,Y). If
 *                   we do activate a node, delete it. If we now
 *                   have less than 3 nodes, go back to Define state.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Reset
 *        widget state is:
 *            Start: Do nothing.
 *            Define: Remove all points and line segments of the contour.
 *                 Essentially calls Initialize(NULL)
 *            Manipulate: Do nothing.
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * This widget invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers
 * can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (beginning to interact)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (completing interaction)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (moving after selecting something)
 *   vtkCommand::PlacePointEvent (after point is positioned;
 *                                call data includes handle id (0,1))
 *   vtkCommand::WidgetValueChangedEvent (Invoked when the contour is closed
 *                                        for the first time. )
 * </pre>
