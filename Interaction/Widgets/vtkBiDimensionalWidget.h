 * @class   vtkBiDimensionalWidget
 * @brief   measure the bi-dimensional lengths of an object
 *
 * The vtkBiDimensionalWidget is used to measure the bi-dimensional length of
 * an object. The bi-dimensional measure is defined by two finite, orthogonal
 * lines that intersect within the finite extent of both lines.
 * The lengths of these two lines gives the bi-dimensional measure. Each line
 * is defined by two handle widgets at the end points of each line.
 *
 * The orthogonal constraint on the two lines limits how the four end points
 * can be positioned. The first two points can be placed arbitrarily to define
 * the first line (similar to vtkDistanceWidget). The placement of the third
 * point is limited by the finite extent of the first line. As the third point
 * is placed, the fourth point is placed on the opposite side of the first
 * line. Once the third point is placed, the second line is defined since the
 * fourth point is defined at the same time, but the fourth point can be moved
 * along the second line (i.e., maintaining the orthogonal relationship between
 * the two lines). Once defined, any of the four points can be moved along
 * their constraint lines. Also, each line can be translated along the other
 * line (in an orthogonal direction), and the whole bi-dimensional widget can
 * be rotated about its center point (see the description of the event
 * bindings). Finally, selecting the point where the two orthogonal axes
 * intersect, the entire widget can be translated in any direction.
 *
 * Placement of any point results in a special PlacePointEvent invocation so
 * that special operations may be performed to reposition the point. Motion of
 * any point, moving the lines, or rotating the widget cause InteractionEvents
 * to be invoked. Note that the widget has two fundamental modes: a define mode
 * (when initially placing the points) and a manipulate mode (after the points
 * are placed). Line translation and rotation are only possible in manipulate
 * mode.
 *
 * To use this widget, specify an instance of vtkBiDimensionalWidget and a
 * representation (e.g., vtkBiDimensionalRepresentation2D). The widget is
 * implemented using four instances of vtkHandleWidget which are used to
 * position the end points of the two intersecting lines. The representations
 * for these handle widgets are provided by the vtkBiDimensionalRepresentation
 * class.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - define a point or manipulate a handle, line,
 *                          perform rotation or translate the widget.
 *   MouseMoveEvent - position the points, move a line, rotate or translate the widget
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the selected handle and end interaction
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkBiDimensionalWidget's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::AddPoint -- (In Define mode:) Add one point; depending on the
 *                               state it may the first, second, third or fourth
 *                               point added. (In Manipulate mode:) If near a handle,
 *                               select the handle. Or if near a line, select the line.
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- (In Define mode:) Position the second, third or fourth
 *                           point. (In Manipulate mode:) Move the handle, line or widget.
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the manipulation process has completed.
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * This widget invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers
 * can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (beginning to interact)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (completing interaction)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (moving a handle, line or performing rotation)
 *   vtkCommand::PlacePointEvent (after a point is positioned;
 *                                call data includes handle id (0,1,2,4))
 * </pre>
