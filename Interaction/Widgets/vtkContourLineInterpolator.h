/**
 * @class   vtkContourLineInterpolator
 * @brief   Defines API for interpolating/modifying nodes from a vtkContourRepresentation
 *
 * vtkContourLineInterpolator is an abstract base class for interpolators
 * that are used by the vtkContourRepresentation class to interpolate
 * and/or modify nodes in a contour. Subclasses must override the virtual
 * method \c InterpolateLine. This is used by the contour representation
 * to give the interpolator a chance to define an interpolation scheme
 * between nodes. See vtkBezierContourLineInterpolator for a concrete
 * implementation. Subclasses may also override \c UpdateNode. This provides
 * a way for the representation to give the interpolator a chance to modify
 * the nodes, as the user constructs the contours. For instance, a sticky
 * contour widget may be implemented that moves nodes to nearby regions of
 * high gradient, to be used in contour-guided segmentation.
