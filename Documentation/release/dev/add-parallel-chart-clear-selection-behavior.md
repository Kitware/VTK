## Add behavior to clear one axis or all axes selection in vtkChartParallelCoordinates

For parallel coordinates charts, data selection can now be interactively cleared:
- Left clicking without dragging on an axis clears the selected axis.
- Left clicking within the chart area outside of the axes area clears the entire chart selection.
