## Added an IFC reader based on IfcOpenShell library

The IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format is an open standard for
exchanging Building Information Modeling (BIM) data in the
architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.

IFC format supports both meshes and parametric surfaces. Parametric
surfaces are converted to meshes using occt (OpenCascade).
