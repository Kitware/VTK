/**
 * @class   vtkProcessGroup
 * @brief   A subgroup of processes from a communicator.
 *
 *
 *
 * This class is used for creating groups of processes.  A vtkProcessGroup is
 * initialized by passing the controller or communicator on which the group is
 * based off of.  You can then use the group to subset and reorder the the
 * processes.  Eventually, you can pass the group object to the
 * CreateSubController method of vtkMultiProcessController to create a
 * controller for the defined group of processes.  You must use the same
 * controller (or attached communicator) from which this group was initialized
 * with.
 *
 * @sa
 * vtkMultiProcessController, vtkCommunicator
 *
 * @par Thanks:
 * This class was originally written by Kenneth Moreland (kmorel@sandia.gov)
 * from Sandia National Laboratories.
