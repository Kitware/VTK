 * The vtkPolyDataToImageStencil class will convert polydata into
 * an image stencil.  The polydata can either be a closed surface
 * mesh or a series of polyline contours (one contour per slice).
 * @warning
 * If contours are provided, the contours must be aligned with the
 * Z planes.  Other contour orientations are not supported.
