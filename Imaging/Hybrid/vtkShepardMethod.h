/**
 * @class   vtkShepardMethod
 * @brief   interpolate points and associated scalars onto volume
 * using the method of Shepard
 *
 *
 * vtkShepardMethod is a filter used to interpolate point scalar values using
 * Shepard's method. The method works by resampling the scalars associated
 * with points defined on an arbitrary dataset onto a volume (i.e.,
 * structured points) dataset. The influence functions are described as
 * "inverse distance weighted". Once the interpolation is performed across
 * the volume, the usual volume visualization techniques (e.g.,
 * iso-contouring or volume rendering) can be used.
 *
 * Note that this implementation also provides the ability to specify the
 * power parameter p. Given the generalized Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
 * function with distance between points measured as d(x,xi), p is defined
 * as:
 * <pre>
 * u(x) = Sum(wi(x) * ui) / Sum(wi(x)) if d(x,xi) != 0
 * u(x) = ui                           if d(x,xi) == 0
 *
 * where wi(x) = 1 / (d(x,xi)^p
 * </pre>
 * Typically p=2, so the weights wi(x) are the inverse of the distance
 * squared. However, power parameters > 2 can be used which assign higher
 * weights for data closer to the interpolated point; or <2 which assigns
 * greater weight to points further away. (Note that if p!=2, performance may
 * be significantly impacted as the algorihm is tuned for p=2.)
 *
 * @warning
 * Strictly speaking, this is a modified Shepard's methodsince only points
 * within the MaxiumDistance are used for interpolation. By setting the
 * maximum distance to include the entire bounding box and therefore all
 * points, the class executes much slower but incorporates all points into
 * the interpolation process (i.e., a pure Shepard method).
 *
 * @warning
 * The input to this filter is any dataset type. This filter can be used to
 * resample the points of any type of dataset onto the output volume; i.e.,
 * the input data need not be unstructured with explicit point
 * representations.
 *
 * @warning
 * The bounds of the data (i.e., the sample space) is automatically computed
 * if not set by the user.
 *
 * @warning
 * If you use a maximum distance less than 1.0 (i.e., using a modified
 * Shephard's method), some output points may never receive a
 * contribution. The final value of these points can be specified with the
 * "NullValue" instance variable.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
