 * @class   vtkCheckerboardSplatter
 * @brief   splat points into a volume with an elliptical, Gaussian distribution
 *
 * vtkCheckerboardSplatter is a filter that injects input points into a
 * structured points (volume) dataset using a multithreaded 8-way
 * checkerboard approach. It produces a scalar field of a specified type. As
 * each point is injected, it "splats" or distributes values to nearby
 * voxels. Data is distributed using an elliptical, Gaussian distribution
 * function. The distribution function is modified using scalar values
 * (expands distribution) or normals (creates ellipsoidal distribution rather
 * than spherical). This algorithm is designed for scalability through
 * multithreading.
 *
 * In general, the Gaussian distribution function f(x) around a given
 * splat point p is given by
 *
 *     f(x) = ScaleFactor * exp( ExponentFactor*((r/Radius)**2) )
 *
 * where x is the current voxel sample point; r is the distance |x-p|
 * ExponentFactor <= 0.0, and ScaleFactor can be multiplied by the scalar
 * value of the point p that is currently being splatted.
 *
 * If point normals are present (and NormalWarping is on), then the splat
 * function becomes elliptical (as compared to the spherical one described
 * by the previous equation). The Gaussian distribution function then
 * becomes:
 *
 *     f(x) = ScaleFactor *
 *               exp( ExponentFactor*( ((rxy/E)**2 + z**2)/R**2) )
 *
 * where E is a user-defined eccentricity factor that controls the elliptical
 * shape of the splat; z is the distance of the current voxel sample point
 * along normal N; and rxy is the distance of x in the direction
 * prependicular to N.
 *
 * This class is typically used to convert point-valued distributions into
 * a volume representation. The volume is then usually iso-surfaced or
 * volume rendered to generate a visualization. It can be used to create
 * surfaces from point distributions, or to create structure (i.e.,
 * topology) when none exists.
 *
 * This class makes use of vtkSMPTools to implement a parallel, shared-memory
 * implementation. Hence performance will be significantly improved if VTK is
 * built with VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE set to something other than
 * "Sequential" (typically TBB). For example, on a standard laptop with four
 * threads it is common to see a >10x speedup as compared to the serial
 * version of vtkGaussianSplatter.
 *
 * In summary, the algorithm operates by dividing the volume into a 3D
 * checkerboard, where the squares of the checkerboard overlay voxels in the
 * volume. The checkerboard overlay is designed as a function of the splat
 * footprint, so that when splatting occurs in a group (or color) of
 * checkerboard squares, the splat operation will not cause write contention
 * as the splatting proceeds in parallel. There are eight colors in this
 * checkerboard (like an octree) and parallel splatting occurs simultaneously
 * in one of the eight colors (e.g., octants). A single splat operation
 * (across the given 3D footprint) may also be parallelized if the splat is
 * large enough.
 *
 * @warning
 * The input to this filter is of type vtkPointSet. Currently only real types
 * (e.g., float, double) are supported as input, but this could easily be
 * extended to other types. The output type is limited to real types as well.
 *
 * @warning
 * Some voxels may never receive a contribution during the splatting process.
 * The final value of these points can be specified with the "NullValue"
 * instance variable. Note that NullValue is also the initial value of the
 * output voxel values and will affect the accumulation process.
 *
 * @warning
 * While this class is very similar to vtkGaussianSplatter, it does produce
 * slightly different output in most cases (due to the way the footprint is
 * computed).
