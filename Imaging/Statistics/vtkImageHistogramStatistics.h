/**
 * @class   vtkImageHistogramStatistics
 * @brief   Compute statistics for an image
 *
 * vtkImageHistogramStatistics computes statistics such as mean, median, and
 * standard deviation.  These statistics are computed from the histogram
 * of the image, rather than from the image itself, because this is more
 * efficient than computing the statistics while traversing the pixels.
 * If the input image is of type float or double, then the precision of
 * the Mean, Median, and StandardDeviation will depend on the number of
 * histogram bins.  By default, 65536 bins are used for float data, giving
 * at least 16 bits of precision.
 * @par Thanks:
 * Thanks to David Gobbi at the Seaman Family MR Centre and Dept. of Clinical
 * Neurosciences, Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, for providing this class.
