// .NAME vtkCGMWriter - write polygonal data as a CGM file
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCGMWriter writes CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) output. CGM is a 2D
// graphics vector format typically used by large plotters. This writer can 
// handle vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips in any combination. 
// Colors are specified either 1) from cell scalars (assumed to be RGB or 
// RGBA color specification), 2) from a specified color; or 3) randomly 
// assigned colors.
//
// Note: During output of the polygonal data, stringle strips are converted
// to triangles, and polylines to lines. Also, due to limitations in the CGM 
// color model, only 256 colors are available to the color palette.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The class vtkImageToPolyDataFilter is convenient for converting a raster
// image into polygons (and color map) suitable for plotting with CGM.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPolyDataWriter vtkPointDataToCellData
