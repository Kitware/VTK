/**
 * @class   vtkOutputStream
 * @brief   Wraps a binary output stream with a VTK interface.
 *
 * vtkOutputStream provides a VTK-style interface wrapping around a
 * standard output stream.  The access methods are virtual so that
 * subclasses can transparently provide encoding of the output.  Data
 * lengths for Write calls refer to the length of the data in memory.
 * The actual length in the stream may differ for subclasses that
 * implement an encoding scheme.
