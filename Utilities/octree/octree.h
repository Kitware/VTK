/**\brief An n-dimensional octree. Perhaps it should be named a tttntree (two-to-the n tree)?
  *
  * This templated class provides an n-dimensional binary tree, storing an
  * object whose type is specified by the first template parameter at each
  * node (whether or not that node is a leaf).
  * The second template parameter is an integer constant specifying the
  * dimension of the tree.
  * The final template parameter takes an allocator object just as the STL does.
  *
  * The tree itself stores the center and overall bounds of the root node;
  * the nodes themselves do not contain any information on the geometry.
  * If needed, it can be derived from an octree_path object referring to
  * the node or stored in the template class at each node for fast access.
  * This makes the class useful for storing abstract trees with minimal overhead
  * as well as trees embedded in a metric space.
  *
  * Access to entries in the tree is provided by octree_cursor and octree_iterator
  * objects, both of which inherit octree_path.
  * An octree_path stores a vector of integers describing a descent from the root
  * node to a particular child node of the octree.
  * Since each node of a \f$d\f$-dimensional tree has \f$2^d\f$ children,
  * the integers in the vector will all be in \f$\{0,\ldots,2^d-1\}\f$.
  *
  * The octree_cursor class provides a free-form way to visit nodes in the octree;
  * it does not behave like an interator that guarantees each node will be visited once.
  * Instead, it provides a way to move up, down, and across the tree from any location.
  * This makes it useful for local queries that do not need to traverse the entire tree.
  *
  * The octree_iterator class simply traverses the tree in depth-first order
  * and can be configured to visit only leaf nodes or to include all nodes.

    * are visited.
    *
    * You may add or remove children while iterating with some caveats.
    * When adding children, any iterator currently referencing the node
    * to which children were added will reference the first child node
    * when incremented. Iterators confined to leaf nodes may reference
    * non-leaf nodes when refinement occurs between increments/decrements.
    * When removing children from node \a A, any iterators pointing to
    * grandchildren of \a A will become invalid. Iterators pointing to
    * children of \a A may not be dereferenced but may be incremented or
    * decremented safely.
