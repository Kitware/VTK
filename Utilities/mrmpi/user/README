This directory will eventually contain MapReduce programs written by
the developers and users which call the MapReduce MPI library.

At this initial release, it's empty.

If you write a MapReduce program you'd like to contribute to the
distrubution, please send an email to Steve Plimpton: sjplimp at
sandia.gov.

See the examples dir for other MapReduce programs.
