/**
 * @class   vtkPythonInterpreter
 * @brief   wrapper for an embedded Python interpreter.
 *
 * vtkPythonInterpreter only offers static methods. However, there may be need
 * to register callbacks to call after the Python interpreter is initialized
 * and before the interpreter is finalized. One can register observers for
 * vtkCommand:EnterEvent and vtkCommand::ExitEvent to a local instance of
 * vtkPythonInterpreter. vtkPythonInterpreter keeps tracks of all instances and
 * invokes those events on all instances at appropriate times.
 *
 * Same is true for obtaining outputs/errors generated by Python.
 * vtkCommand::ErrorEvent and vtkCommand::SetOutputEvent will be fired with
 * calldata being const char* to the messages. Note that by default, the texts
 * will be dumped on stdout/stderr in any case.
 *
 * To capture stdin, especially for non-terminal applications, set CaptureStdin
 * to true. In that case vtkCommand::UpdateEvent will be fired with the calldata
 * being a reference to a vtkStdString that should be filled in with the text to
 * be passed in as the input.
 *
 * A few of the methods on this class implicitly call
 * vtkPythonInterpreter::Initialize() to ensure Python is initialized viz.
 * vtkPythonInterpreter::PyMain() and vtkPythonInterpreter::RunSimpleString().
 * These implicit initialization always calls
 * vtkPythonInterpreter::Initialize(1). If that's not what is expected,
 * ensure that you call vtkPythonInterpreter::Initialize(0) before calling such
 * methods. Refer to Py_InitializeEx() documentation for details on the
 * differences between the two.
 *
 * Notes on calling Initialize/Finalize multiple times: Although applications
 * are free to call Initialize/Finalize pairs multiple times, there are subtle
 * differences between the first Initialize and subsequence Initialize calls
 * after Finalize especially when concerning with imported modules. Refer to
 * Python docs for details. In short, modules like numpy don't continue to work
 * after a re-initialize. Hence use it with caution.
