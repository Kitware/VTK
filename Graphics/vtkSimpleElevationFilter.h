// .NAME vtkSimpleElevationFilter - generate scalars along a specified direction
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSimpleElevationFilter is a filter to generate scalar values from a
// dataset.  The scalar values are generated by dotting a user-specified
// vector against a vector defined from the input dataset points to the
// origin.
