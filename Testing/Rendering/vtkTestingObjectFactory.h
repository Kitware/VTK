/**
 * @class   vtkTestingObjectFactory
 * @brief   Object overrides used during testing
 *
 * Some vtk examples and tests need to perform differently when they
 * are run as tests versus when they are run as individual
 * programs. Many tests/examples are interactive and eventually call
 * vtkRenderWindowInteration::Start() to initialie the
 * interaction. But, when run as tests, these programs should
 * exit. This factory overrides vtkRenderWindowInteractor so that the
 * Start() method just returns.
 * To use this factory:
