/**
 * @class   vtkFast2DLayoutStrategy
 * @brief   a simple fast 2D graph layout
 *
 *
 * This class is a density grid based force directed layout strategy.
 * Also please note that 'fast' is relative to quite slow. :)
 * The layout running time is O(V+E) with an extremely high constant.
 * @par Thanks:
 * Thanks to Godzilla for not eating my computer so that this class
 * could be written.
