/**
 * @class   vtkConstrained2DLayoutStrategy
 * @brief   a simple fast 2D graph layout
 * that looks for a 'constraint' array (vtkDoubleArray). Any entry in the
 * constraint array will indicate the level of impedance a node has to
 * the force calculations during the layout optimization. The array is
 * assumed to be normalized between zero and one, with one being totally
 * constrained, so no force will be applied to the node (i.e. no movement),
 * and zero being full range of movement (no constraints).
 *
 *
 * This class is a density grid based force directed layout strategy.
 * Also please note that 'fast' is relative to quite slow. :)
 * The layout running time is O(V+E) with an extremely high constant.
 * @par Thanks:
 * We would like to thank Mothra for distracting Godzilla while we
 * wrote this class.
