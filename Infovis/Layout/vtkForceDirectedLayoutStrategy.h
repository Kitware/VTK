/**
 * @class   vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy
 * @brief   a force directed graph layout algorithm
 *
 *
 * Lays out a graph in 2D or 3D using a force-directed algorithm.
 * The user may specify whether to layout the graph randomly initially,
 * the bounds, the number of dimensions (2 or 3), and the cool-down rate.
 *
 * @par Thanks:
 * Thanks to Brian Wylie for adding functionality for allowing this layout
 * to be incremental.
