/**
 * @class   vtkSimple2DLayoutStrategy
 * @brief   a simple 2D graph layout
 *
 *
 * This class is an implementation of the work presented in:
 * Fruchterman & Reingold "Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement"
 * Software-Practice and Experience 21(11) 1991).
 * The class includes some optimizations but nothing too fancy.
 *
 * @par Thanks:
 * Thanks to Brian Wylie from Sandia National Laboratories for creating this
 * class.
