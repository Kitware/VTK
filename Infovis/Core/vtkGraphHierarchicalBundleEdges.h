/**
 * @class   vtkGraphHierarchicalBundleEdges
 * @brief   layout graph arcs in bundles
 *
 *
 * This algorithm creates a vtkPolyData from a vtkGraph.  As opposed to
 * vtkGraphToPolyData, which converts each arc into a straight line, each arc
 * is converted to a polyline, following a tree structure.  The filter requires
 * both a vtkGraph and vtkTree as input.  The tree vertices must be a
 * superset of the graph vertices.  A common example is when the graph vertices
 * correspond to the leaves of the tree, but the internal vertices of the tree
 * represent groupings of graph vertices.  The algorithm matches the vertices
 * using the array "PedigreeId".  The user may alternately set the
 * DirectMapping flag to indicate that the two structures must have directly
 * corresponding offsets (i.e. node i in the graph must correspond to node i in
 * the tree).
 *
 * The vtkGraph defines the topology of the output vtkPolyData (i.e.
 * the connections between nodes) while the vtkTree defines the geometry (i.e.
 * the location of nodes and arc routes).  Thus, the tree must have been
 * assigned vertex locations, but the graph does not need locations, in fact
 * they will be ignored.  The edges approximately follow the path from the
 * source to target nodes in the tree.  A bundling parameter controls how
 * closely the edges are bundled together along the tree structure.
 *
 * You may follow this algorithm with vtkSplineFilter in order to make nicely
 * curved edges.
 *
 * @par Thanks:
 * This algorithm was developed in the paper
 * Danny Holten. Hierarchical Edge Bundles: Visualization of Adjacency Relations
 * Relations in Hierarchical Data. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and
 * Computer Graphics, Vol. 12, No. 5, 2006. pp. 741-748.
