/**
 * @class   vtkCollapseGraph
 * @brief   "Collapses" vertices onto their neighbors.
 *
 *
 * vtkCollapseGraph "collapses" vertices onto their neighbors, while maintaining
 * connectivity.  Two inputs are required - a graph (directed or undirected),
 * and a vertex selection that can be converted to indices.
 *
 * Conceptually, each of the vertices specified in the input selection
 * expands, "swallowing" adacent vertices.  Edges to-or-from the "swallowed"
 * vertices become edges to-or-from the expanding vertices, maintaining the
 * overall graph connectivity.
 *
 * In the case of directed graphs, expanding vertices only swallow vertices that
 * are connected via out edges.  This rule provides intuitive behavior when
 * working with trees, so that "child" vertices collapse into their parents
 * when the parents are part of the input selection.
 *
 * Input port 0: graph
 * Input port 1: selection
