![VTK - The Visualization Toolkit][vtk-banner]

Introduction
============

VTK is an open-source software system for image processing, 3D
graphics, volume rendering and visualization. VTK includes many
advanced algorithms (e.g., surface reconstruction, implicit modeling,
decimation) and rendering techniques (e.g., hardware-accelerated
volume rendering, LOD control).

VTK is used by academicians for teaching and research; by government
research institutions such as Los Alamos National Lab in the US or
CINECA in Italy; and by many commercial firms who use VTK to build or
extend products.

The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" originally published by
Prentice Hall and now published by Kitware, Inc. (Third Edition ISBN
1-930934-07-6). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994) to a
world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research
communities.

Learning Resources
==================

* General information is available at the [VTK Homepage][vtk-homepage].

* Community discussion takes place on the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum.

* Commercial [support and training][kitware-support]
  are available from [Kitware][].

* Doxygen-generated nightly reference documentation is
  available [online][vtk-doxygen].

* There is now a large collection of [VTK Examples][vtk-examples] that
  showcase VTK features and provide a useful learning resource.

Reporting Bugs
==============

If you have found a bug:

1. If you have a patch, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md][vtk-contributing] document.

2. Otherwise, please join the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum and ask
   about the expected and observed behaviors to determine if it is
   really a bug.

3. Finally, if the issue is not resolved by the above steps, open
   an entry in the [VTK Issue Tracker][vtk-issues].
