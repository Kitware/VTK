 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The C++ API provides C++ wrappers for the HDF5 C library.
 * It is assumed that the user has knowledge of the HDF5 file format
 * and its components.  If you are not familiar with HDF5 file format,
 * and would like to find out more, please refer to the HDF5 documentation
 * at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.intro.html
 *
 * Because the HDF5 library maps very well to
 * the object oriented design approach, classes in the C++ API can
 * closely represent the interfaces of the HDF5 APIs, as followed:
 *
 * \verbatim
 	HDF5 C APIs				C++ Classes
 	-----------				-----------
 	Attribute Interface (H5A)		Attribute
 	Datasets Interface (H5D)		DataSet
 	Error Interface (H5E)			Exception
 	File Interface (H5F)			H5File
 	Group Interface (H5G)			Group
 	Identifier Interface (H5I)		IdComponent
 	Property List Interface (H5P)		PropList and subclasses
 	Dataspace Interface (H5S)		DataSpace
 	Datatype Interface (H5T)		DataType and subclasses
  \endverbatim
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * Please refer to the file release_docs/INSTALL_Windows.txt
 * under the top directory for information about installing, building,
 * and testing the C++ API.
