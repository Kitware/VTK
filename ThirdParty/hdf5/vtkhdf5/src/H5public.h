 *              structures.
 *          \li Array free lists manage memory for arrays of internal
 *              data structures.
 *          \li Block free lists manage memory for arbitrarily-sized blocks
 *              of bytes.
 *          \li Factory free lists manage memory for fixed-size blocks of
 *              bytes.
 *
 *          The parameters specify global and per-list limits; for example, \p
 *          reg_global_limit and \p reg_list_limit limit the accumulated size
 *          of all regular free lists and the size of each individual regular
 *          free list, respectively. Therefore, if an application sets a 1Mb
 *          limit on each of the global lists, up to 4Mb of total storage might
 *          be allocated, 1Mb for each of the regular, array, block, and
 *          factory type lists.
 *
 *          The settings specified for block free lists are duplicated for
 *          factory free lists. Therefore, increasing the global limit on block
 *          free lists by x bytes will increase the potential free list memory
 *          usage by 2x bytes.
 *
 *          Using a value of -1 for a limit means that no limit is set for the
 *          specified type of free list.
 *
 * \version 1.8.3 Function changed in this release to set factory free list
 *                memory limits.
