 * \section sec_datatype HDF5 Datatypes
 * HDF5 datatypes describe the element type of HDF5 datasets and attributes.
 * There's a large set of predefined datatypes, but users may find it useful
 * to define new datatypes through a process called \Emph{derivation}.
 *
 * The element type is automatically persisted as part of the HDF5 metadata of
 * attributes and datasets. Additionally, datatype definitions can be persisted
 * to HDF5 files and linked to groups as HDF5 datatype objects or so-called
 * \Emph{committed datatypes}.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_intro Introduction and Definitions
 *
 * An HDF5 dataset is an array of data elements, arranged according to the specifications
 * of the dataspace. In general, a data element is the smallest addressable unit of storage
 * in the HDF5 file. (Compound datatypes are the exception to this rule.) The HDF5 datatype
 * defines the storage format for a single data element. See the figure below.
 *
 * The model for HDF5 attributes is extremely similar to datasets: an attribute has a dataspace
 * and a data type, as shown in the figure below. The information in this chapter applies to both
 * datasets and attributes.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td>

 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Abstractly, each data element within the dataset is a sequence of bits, interpreted as a single
 * value from a set of values (for example, a number or a character). For a given datatype, there is a
 * standard or convention for representing the values as bits, and when the bits are represented in a
 * particular storage the bits are laid out in a specific storage scheme such as 8-bit bytes with a
 * specific ordering and alignment of bytes within the storage array.
 *
 * HDF5 datatypes implement a flexible, extensible, and portable mechanism for specifying and
 * discovering the storage layout of the data elements, determining how to interpret the elements
 * (for example, as floating point numbers), and for transferring data from different compatible
 * layouts.
 *
 * An HDF5 datatype describes one specific layout of bits. A dataset has a single datatype which
 * applies to every data element. When a dataset is created, the storage datatype is defined. After
 * the dataset or attribute is created, the datatype cannot be changed.
 * \li The datatype describes the storage layout of a single data element
 * \li All elements of the dataset must have the same type
 * \li The datatype of a dataset is immutable
 *
 * When data is transferred (for example, a read or write), each end point of the transfer has a
 * datatype, which describes the correct storage for the elements. The source and destination may
 * have different (but compatible) layouts, in which case the data elements are automatically
 * transformed during the transfer.
 *
 * HDF5 datatypes describe commonly used binary formats for numbers (integers
 * and floating point) and characters (ASCII). A given computing architecture and programming language
 * supports certain number and character representations. For example, a computer may support 8-,
 * 16-, 32-, and 64-bit signed integers, stored in memory in little-endian byte order. These would
 * presumably correspond to the C programming language types \Emph{char}, \Emph{short},
 * \Emph{int}, and \Emph{long}.
 *
 * When reading and writing from memory, the HDF5 library must know the appropriate datatype
 * that describes the architecture specific layout. The HDF5 library provides the platform
 * independent \Emph{NATIVE} types, which are mapped to an appropriate datatype for each platform.
 * So the type #H5T_NATIVE_INT is an alias for the appropriate descriptor for each platform.
 *
 * Data in memory has a datatype:
 * \li The storage layout in memory is architecture-specific
 * \li The HDF5 \Emph{NATIVE} types are predefined aliases for the architecture-specific memory layout
 * \li The memory datatype need not be the same as the stored datatype of the dataset
 *
 * In addition to numbers and characters, an HDF5 datatype can describe more abstract classes of
 * types including enumerations, strings, bit strings, and references (pointers to objects in the HDF5
 * file). HDF5 supports several classes of composite datatypes which are combinations of one or
 * more other datatypes. In addition to the standard predefined datatypes, users can define new
 * datatypes within the datatype classes.
 *
 * The HDF5 datatype model is very general and flexible:
 * \li For common simple purposes, only predefined types will be needed
 * \li Datatypes can be combined to create complex structured datatypes
 * \li If needed, users can define custom atomic datatypes
 * \li Committed datatypes can be shared by datasets or attributes
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_model Datatype Model
 * The HDF5 library implements an object-oriented model of datatypes. HDF5 datatypes are
 * organized as a logical set of base types, or datatype classes. Each datatype class defines
 * a format for representing logical values as a sequence of bits. For example the #H5T_INTEGER
 * class is a format for representing twos complement integers of various sizes.
 *
 * A datatype class is defined as a set of one or more datatype properties. A datatype property is
 * a property of the bit string. The datatype properties are defined by the logical model of the
 * datatype class. For example, the integer class (twos complement integers) has properties such as
 * “signed or unsigned”, “length”, and “byte-order”. The float class (IEEE floating point numbers)
 * has these properties, plus “exponent bits”, “exponent sign”, etc.
 *
 * A datatype is derived from one datatype class: a given datatype has a specific value for the
 * datatype properties defined by the class. For example, for 32-bit signed integers, stored
 * big-endian, the HDF5 datatype is a sub-type of integer with the properties set to
 * signed=1, size=4(bytes), and byte-order=BE.
 *
 * The HDF5 datatype API (H5T functions) provides methods to create datatypes of different
 * datatype classes, to set the datatype properties of a new datatype, and to discover the datatype
 * properties of an existing datatype.
 *
 * The datatype for a dataset is stored in the HDF5 file as part of the metadata for the dataset.
 * A datatype can be shared by more than one dataset in the file if the datatype is saved to the
 * file with a name. This shareable datatype is known as a committed datatype. In the past,
 * this kind of datatype was called a named datatype.
 *
 * When transferring data (for example, a read or write), the data elements of the source and
 * destination storage must have compatible types. As a general rule, data elements with the same
 * datatype class are compatible while elements from different datatype classes are not compatible.
 * When transferring data of one datatype to another compatible datatype, the HDF5 Library uses
 * the datatype properties of the source and destination to automatically transform each data
 * element. For example, when reading from data stored as 32-bit signed integers, big
 * endian into 32-bit signed integers, little-endian, the HDF5 Library will automatically swap the
 * bytes.
 *
 * Thus, data transfer operations (\ref H5Dread, \ref H5Dwrite, \ref H5Aread, \ref H5Awrite) require
 * a datatype for both the source and the destination.

 *
 * The HDF5 library defines a set of predefined datatypes, corresponding to commonly used
 * storage formats, such as twos complement integers, IEEE Floating point numbers, etc., 4-
 * and 8-byte sizes, big-endian and little-endian byte orders. In addition, a user can derive types with
 * custom values for the properties. For example, a user program may create a datatype to describe
 * a 6-bit integer, or a 600-bit floating point number.
 *
 * In addition to atomic datatypes, the HDF5 library supports composite datatypes. A composite
 * datatype is an aggregation of one or more datatypes. Each class of composite datatypes has
 * properties that describe the organization of the composite datatype. See the figure below.
 * Composite datatypes include:
 * \li Compound datatypes: structured records
 * \li Array: a multidimensional array of a datatype
 * \li Variable-length: a one-dimensional array of a datatype
 * \li Enumeration: a set of (name, value) pairs, similar to the C/C++ enum type

 * \subsection subsec_datatype_usage How Datatypes are Used
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_usage_object The Datatype Object and the HDF5 Datatype API
 * The HDF5 library manages datatypes as objects. The HDF5 datatype API manipulates the
 * datatype objects through C function calls. New datatypes can be created from scratch or
 * copied from existing datatypes. When a datatype is no longer needed its resources should be released by
 * calling \ref H5Tclose().
 *
 * The datatype object is used in several roles in the HDF5 data model and library. Essentially, a
 * datatype is used whenever the form at of data elements is needed. There are four major uses of
 * datatypes in the HDF5 library: at dataset creation, during data transfers, when discovering the
 * contents of a file, and for specifying user-defined datatypes. See the table below.

 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_usage_create Dataset Creation
 * All the data elements of a dataset have the same datatype. When a dataset is created, the datatype
 * for the data elements must be specified. The datatype of a dataset can never be changed. The
 * example below shows the use of a datatype to create a dataset called “/dset”. In this example, the
 * dataset will be stored as 32-bit signed integers in big-endian order.
 *
 * <em> Using a datatype to create a dataset </em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t dt;
 *
 *   dt = H5Tcopy(H5T_STD_I32BE);
 *   dataset_id = H5Dcreate(file_id, “/dset”, dt, dataspace_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_usage_transfer Data Transfer (Read and Write)
 * Probably the most common use of datatypes is to write or read data from a dataset or attribute. In
 * these operations, each data element is transferred from the source to the destination (possibly
 * rearranging the order of the elements). Since the source and destination do not need to be
 * identical (in other words, one is disk and the other is memory), the transfer requires
 * both the format of the source element and the destination element. Therefore, data transfers use two
 * datatype objects, for the source and destination.
 *
 * When data is written, the source is memory and the destination is disk (file). The memory
 * datatype describes the format of the data element in the machine memory, and the file datatype
 * describes the desired format of the data element on disk. Similarly, when reading, the source
 * datatype describes the format of the data element on disk, and the destination datatype describes
 * the format in memory.
 *
 * In the most common cases, the file datatype is the datatype specified when
 * the dataset was
 * created, and the memory datatype should be the appropriate \Emph{NATIVE} type.
 * The examples below show samples of writing data to and reading data from a dataset. The data
 * in memory is declared C type ‘int’, and the datatype #H5T_NATIVE_INT corresponds to this
 * type. The datatype of the dataset should be of datatype class #H5T_INTEGER.
 *
 * <em> Writing to a dataset </em>
 * \code
 *   int dset_data[DATA_SIZE];
 *
 *   status = H5Dwrite(dataset_id, H5T_NATIVE_INT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, dset_data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em> Reading from a dataset </em>
 * \code
 *   int dset_data[DATA_SIZE];
 *
 *   status = H5Dread(dataset_id, H5T_NATIVE_INT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, dset_data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_usage_discover Discovery of Data Format
 * The HDF5 Library enables a program to
 * determine the datatype class and properties for any
 * datatype. In order to discover the storage format of data in a dataset, the datatype is obtained, and
 * the properties are determined by queries to the datatype object. The example below shows code
 * that analyzes the datatype for an integer and prints out a description of its storage properties
 * (byte order, signed, size).
 *
 * <em> Discovering datatype properties </em>
 * \code
 *   switch (H5Tget_class(type)) {
 *     case H5T_INTEGER:
 *       ord = H5Tget_order(type);
 *       sgn = H5Tget_sign(type);
 *       printf(“Integer ByteOrder= ”);
 *       switch (ord) {
 *         case H5T_ORDER_LE:
 *           printf(“LE”);
 *           break;
 *         case H5T_ORDER_BE:
 *           printf(“BE”);
 *           break;
 *       }
 *       printf(“ Sign= ”);
 *       switch (sgn) {
 *         case H5T_SGN_NONE:
 *           printf(“false”);
 *           break;
 *         case H5T_SGN_2:
 *           printf(“true”);
 *           break;
 *       }
 *       printf(“ Size= ”);
 *       sz = H5Tget_size(type);
 *       printf(“%d”, sz);
 *       printf(“\n”);
 *       break;
 *     case H5T_????
 *       ...
 *       break;
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_usage_user Creating and Using User‐defined Datatypes
 * Most programs will primarily use the predefined datatypes described above, possibly in
 * composite data types such as compound or array datatypes. However, the HDF5 datatype model
 * is extremely general; a user program can define a great variety of atomic datatypes (storage
 * layouts). In particular, the datatype properties can define signed and unsigned integers of any
 * size and byte order, and floating point numbers with different formats, size, and byte order. The
 * HDF5 datatype API provides methods to set these properties.
 *
 * User-defined types can be used to define the layout of data in memory; examples might match
 * some platform specific number format or application defined bit-field. The user-defined type can
 * also describe data in the file such as an application-defined format. The user-defined types can be
 * translated to and from standard types of the same class, as described above.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_function Datatype Function Summaries
 * see \ref H5T reference manual provides a reference list of datatype functions, the H5T APIs.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_program Programming Model for Datatypes
 * The HDF5 Library implements an object-oriented model of datatypes. HDF5 datatypes are
 * organized as a logical set of base types, or datatype classes. The HDF5 Library manages
 * datatypes as objects. The HDF5 datatype API manipulates the datatype objects through C
 * function calls. The figure below shows the abstract view of the datatype object. The table below
 * shows the methods (C functions) that operate on datatype objects. New datatypes can be created
 * from scratch or copied from existing datatypes.

 * In order to use a datatype, the object must be created (\ref H5Tcreate / \ref H5Tarray_create2 / etc.),

 * In addition, a reference to the datatype of a dataset or attribute can be obtained with
 * \ref H5Dget_type or \ref H5Aget_type. For composite datatypes a reference to the datatype for
 * members or base types can be obtained (\ref H5Tget_member_type, \ref H5Tget_super). When the datatype
 * object is no longer needed, the reference is discarded with \ref H5Tclose.
 *
 * Two datatype objects can be tested to see if they are the same with \ref H5Tequal. This function
 * returns true if the two datatype references refer to the same datatype object. However, if two
 * datatype objects define equivalent datatypes (the same datatype class and datatype properties),
 * they will not be considered ‘equal’.
 *
 * A datatype can be written to the file as a first class object (\ref H5Tcommit). This is a committed
 * datatype and can be used in the same way as any other datatype.

 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_program_define Definition of Datatypes
 * The HDF5 library enables user programs to create and modify datatypes. The essential steps are:
 * <ul><li>1. Create a new datatype object of a specific composite datatype class, or copy an existing
 * atomic datatype object</li>
 * <li>2. Set properties of the datatype object</li>
 * <li>3. Use the datatype object</li>
 * <li>4. Close the datatype object</li></ul>
 *
 * To create a user-defined atomic datatype, the procedure is to clone a predefined datatype of the
 * appropriate datatype class (\ref H5Tcopy), and then set the datatype properties appropriate to the
 * datatype class. The table below shows how to create a datatype to describe a 1024-bit unsigned
 * integer.
 *
 * <em>Create a new datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t new_type = H5Tcopy (H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *
 *   H5Tset_precision(new_type, 1024);
 *   H5Tset_sign(new_type, H5T_SGN_NONE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Composite datatypes are created with a specific API call for each datatype class. The table below
 * shows the creation method for each datatype class. A newly created datatype cannot be used until the
 * datatype properties are set. For example, a newly created compound datatype has no members and cannot
 * be used.

 *
 * Once the datatype is created and the datatype properties set, the datatype object can be used.
 *
 * Predefined datatypes are defined by the library during initialization using the same mechanisms
 * as described here. Each predefined datatype is locked (\ref H5Tlock), so that it cannot be changed or
 * destroyed. User-defined datatypes may also be locked using \ref H5Tlock.
 *
 * <h4>User-defined Atomic Datatypes</h4>
 * Table 15 summarizes the API methods that set properties of atomic types. Table 16 shows
 * properties specific to numeric types, Table 17 shows properties specific to the string datatype
 * class. Note that offset, pad, etc. do not apply to strings. Table 18 shows the specific property of

 * <h4>Examples</h4>
 * The example below shows how to create a 128-bit little-endian signed integer type. Increasing
 * the precision of a type automatically increases the total size. Note that the proper
 * procedure is to begin from a type of the intended datatype class which in this case is a
 * NATIVE INT.
 *
 * <em>Create a new 128-bit little-endian signed integer datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t new_type = H5Tcopy (H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   H5Tset_precision (new_type, 128);
 *   H5Tset_order (new_type, H5T_ORDER_LE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The figure below shows the storage layout as the type is defined. The \ref H5Tcopy creates a
 * datatype that is the same as #H5T_NATIVE_INT. In this example, suppose this is a 32-bit
 * big-endian number (Figure a). The precision is set to 128 bits, which automatically extends
 * the size to 8 bytes (Figure b). Finally, the byte order is set to little-endian (Figure c).

 * To illustrate the properties of the integer datatype class, the example below shows how to create
 * a user-defined datatype that describes a 24-bit signed integer that starts on the third bit of a 32-bit
 * word. The datatype is specialized from a 32-bit integer, the precision is set to 24 bits, and the
 * offset is set to 3.
 *
 * <em>A user-defined datatype with a 24-bit signed integer</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t dt;
 *
 *   dt = H5Tcopy(H5T_SDT_I32LE);
 *   H5Tset_precision(dt, 24);
 *   H5Tset_offset(dt,3);
 *   H5Tset_pad(dt, H5T_PAD_ZERO, H5T_PAD_ONE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The figure below shows the storage layout for a data element. Note that the unused bits in the

 *
 * <h4>Composite Datatypes</h4>
 * All composite datatypes must be user-defined; there are no predefined composite datatypes.
 *
 * <h4>Compound Datatypes</h4>
 * The subsections below describe how to create a compound datatype and how to write and read
 * data of a compound datatype.
 *
 * <h4>Defining Compound Datatypes</h4>
 *
 * Compound datatypes are conceptually similar to a C struct or Fortran derived types. The
 * compound datatype defines a contiguous sequence of bytes, which are formatted using one up to
 * 2^16 datatypes (members). A compound datatype may have any number of members, in any
 * order, and the members may have any datatype, including compound. Thus, complex nested
 * compound datatypes can be created. The total size of the compound datatype is greater than or
 * equal to the sum of the size of its members, up to a maximum of 2^32 bytes. HDF5 does not
 * support datatypes with distinguished records or the equivalent of C unions or Fortran
 * EQUIVALENCE statements.
 *
 * Usually a C struct or Fortran derived type will be defined to hold a data point in memory, and the
 * offsets of the members in memory will be the offsets of the struct members from the beginning
 * of an instance of the struct. The HDF5 C library provides a macro #HOFFSET (s,m)to calculate
 * the member's offset. The HDF5 Fortran applications have to calculate offsets by using sizes of
 * members datatypes and by taking in consideration the order of members in the Fortran derived type.
 * \code
 * HOFFSET(s,m)
 * \endcode
 * This macro computes the offset of member m within a struct s
 * \code
 * offsetof(s,m)
 * \endcode
 * This macro defined in stddef.h does exactly the same thing as the HOFFSET()macro.
 *
 * Note for Fortran users: Offsets of Fortran structure members correspond to the offsets within a
 * packed datatype (see explanation below) stored in an HDF5 file.
 *
 * Each member of a compound datatype must have a descriptive name which is the key used to
 * uniquely identify the member within the compound datatype. A member name in an HDF5
 * datatype does not necessarily have to be the same as the name of the member in the C struct or
 * Fortran derived type, although this is often the case. Nor does one need to define all members of
 * the C struct or Fortran derived type in the HDF5 compound datatype (or vice versa).
 *
 * Unlike atomic datatypes which are derived from other atomic datatypes, compound datatypes are
 * created from scratch. First, one creates an empty compound datatype and specifies its total size.
 * Then members are added to the compound datatype in any order. Each member type is inserted
 * at a designated offset. Each member has a name which is the key used to uniquely identify the
 * member within the compound datatype.
 *
 * The example below shows a way of creating an HDF5 C compound datatype to describe a
 * complex number. This is a structure with two components, “real” and “imaginary”, and each
 * component is a double. An equivalent C struct whose type is defined by the complex_tstruct is
 * shown.
 *
 * <em>A compound datatype for complex numbers in C</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct {
 *     double re; //real part
 *     double im; //imaginary part
 *   } complex_t;
 *
 *   hid_t complex_id = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof (complex_t));
 *   H5Tinsert (complex_id, “real”, HOFFSET(complex_t,re),
 *   H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *   H5Tinsert (complex_id, “imaginary”, HOFFSET(complex_t,im),
 *   H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The example below shows a way of creating an HDF5 Fortran compound datatype to describe a
 * complex number. This is a Fortran derived type with two components, “real” and “imaginary”,
 * and each component is DOUBLE PRECISION. An equivalent Fortran TYPE whose type is defined
 * by the TYPE complex_t is shown.
 *
 * <em>A compound datatype for complex numbers in Fortran</em>
 * \code
 *   TYPE complex_t
 *       DOUBLE PRECISION re ! real part
 *       DOUBLE PRECISION im; ! imaginary part
 *   END TYPE complex_t
 *
 *   CALL h5tget_size_f(H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE, re_size, error)
 *   CALL h5tget_size_f(H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE, im_size, error)
 *   complex_t_size = re_size + im_size
 *   CALL h5tcreate_f(H5T_COMPOUND_F, complex_t_size, type_id)
 *   offset = 0
 *   CALL h5tinsert_f(type_id, “real”, offset, H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE, error)
 *   offset = offset + re_size
 *   CALL h5tinsert_f(type_id, “imaginary”, offset, H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE, error)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Important Note: The compound datatype is created with a size sufficient to hold all its members.
 * In the C example above, the size of the C struct and the #HOFFSET macro are used as a
 * convenient mechanism to determine the appropriate size and offset. Alternatively, the size and
 * offset could be manually determined: the size can be set to 16 with “real” at offset 0 and
 * “imaginary” at offset 8. However, different platforms and compilers have different sizes for
 * “double” and may have alignment restrictions which require additional padding within the
 * structure. It is much more portable to use the #HOFFSET macro which assures that the values will
 * be correct for any platform.
 *
 * The figure below shows how the compound datatype would be laid out assuming that
 * NATIVE_DOUBLE are 64-bit numbers and that there are no alignment requirements. The total
 * size of the compound datatype will be 16 bytes, the “real” component will start at byte 0, and
 * “imaginary” will start at byte 8.

 * The members of a compound datatype may be any HDF5 datatype including the compound,
 * array, and variable-length (VL) types. The figure and example below show the memory layout
 * and code which creates a compound datatype composed of two complex values, and each
 * complex value is also a compound datatype as in the figure above.

 *   hid_t complex_id, surf_id; // hdf5 datatypes

 *   H5Tinsert (surf_id, “y”, HOFFSET(surf_t, y), complex_id);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that a similar result could be accomplished by creating a compound datatype and inserting
 * four fields. See the figure below. This results in the same layout as the figure above. The difference
 * would be how the fields are addressed. In the first case, the real part of ‘y’ is called ‘y.re’;
 * in the second case it is ‘y-re’.
 *
 * <em>Another compound datatype nested in a compound datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct {
 *     complex_t x;
 *     complex_t y;
 *   } surf_t;

 *   hid_t surf_id = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(surf_t));
 *   H5Tinsert (surf_id, “x-re”, HOFFSET(surf_t, x.re), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *   H5Tinsert (surf_id, “x-im”, HOFFSET(surf_t, x.im), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *   H5Tinsert (surf_id, “y-re”, HOFFSET(surf_t, y.re), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *   H5Tinsert (surf_id, “y-im”, HOFFSET(surf_t, y.im), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The members of a compound datatype do not always fill all the bytes. The #HOFFSET macro
 * assures that the members will be laid out according to the requirements of the platform and
 * language. The example below shows an example of a C struct which requires extra bytes of
 * padding on many platforms. The second element, ‘b’, is a 1-byte character followed by an 8 byte
 * double, ‘c’. On many systems, the 8-byte value must be stored on a 4-or 8-byte boundary. This
 * requires the struct to be larger than the sum of the size of its elements.
 *
 * In the example below, sizeof and #HOFFSET are used to assure that the members are inserted at
 * the correct offset to match the memory conventions of the platform. The figure below shows how
 * this data element would be stored in memory, assuming the double must start on a 4-byte
 * boundary. Notice the extra bytes between ‘b’ and ‘c’.
 *
 * <em>A compound datatype that requires padding</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct {
 *     int    a;
 *     char   b;
 *     double c;
 *   } s1_t;
 *
 *   hid_t s1_tid = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(s1_t));
 *   H5Tinsert (s1_tid, “x-im”, HOFFSET(s1_t, a), H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   H5Tinsert (s1_tid, “y-re”, HOFFSET(s1_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_CHAR);
 *   H5Tinsert (s1_tid, “y-im”, HOFFSET(s1_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);

 * \image html Dtypes_fig12.gif "Memory layout of a compound datatype that requires padding"

 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * However, data stored on disk does not require alignment, so unaligned versions of compound
 * data structures can be created to improve space efficiency on disk. These unaligned compound
 * datatypes can be created by computing offsets by hand to eliminate inter-member padding, or the
 * members can be packed by calling #H5Tpack (which modifies a datatype directly, so it is usually
 * preceded by a call to #H5Tcopy).
 *
 * The example below shows how to create a disk version of the compound datatype from the
 * figure above in order to store data on disk in as compact a form as possible. Packed compound
 * datatypes should generally not be used to describe memory as they may violate alignment
 * constraints for the architecture being used. Note also that using a packed datatype for disk
 * storage may involve a higher data conversion cost.
 *
 * <em>Create a packed compound datatype in C</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t s2_tid = H5Tcopy (s1_tid);
 *   H5Tpack (s2_tid);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The example below shows the sequence of Fortran calls to create a packed compound datatype.
 * An HDF5 Fortran compound datatype never describes a compound datatype in memory and
 * compound data is ALWAYS written by fields as described in the next section. Therefore packing
 * is not needed unless the offset of each consecutive member is not equal to the sum of the sizes of
 * the previous members.
 *
 * <em>Create a packed compound datatype in Fortran</em>
 * \code
 *   CALL h5tcopy_f(s1_id, s2_id, error)
 *   CALL h5tpack_f(s2_id, error)

 *
 * <h4>Creating and Writing Datasets with Compound Datatypes</h4>
 *
 * Creating datasets with compound datatypes is similar to creating datasets with any other HDF5
 * datatypes. But writing and reading may be different since datasets that have compound datatypes
 * can be written or read by a field (member) or subsets of fields (members). The compound
 * datatype is the only composite datatype that supports “sub-setting” by the elements the datatype
 * is built from.
 *
 * The example below shows a C example of creating and writing a dataset with a compound
 * datatype.
 *
 *
 * <em>Create and write a dataset with a compound datatype in C</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct s1_t {
 *     int a;
 *     float b;
 *     double c;
 *   } s1_t;
 *
 *   s1_t data[LENGTH];
 *
 *   // Initialize data
 *   for (i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++) {
 *     data[i].a = i;
 *     data[i].b = i*i;
 *     data[i].c = 1./(i+1);
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   s1_tid = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(s1_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “a_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, a), H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “c_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dcreate(file_id, “SDScompound.h5”, s1_t,
 *   space_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *   H5Dwrite (dataset_id, s1_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The example below shows the content of the file written on a little-endian machine.
 *
 * <em>Create and write a little-endian dataset with a compound datatype in C</em>
 * \code
 *   HDF5 “SDScompound.h5” {
 *   GROUP “/” {
 *      DATASET “ArrayOfStructures” {
 *         DATATYPE H5T_COMPOUND {
 *            H5T_STD_I32LE “a_name”;
 *            H5T_IEEE_F32LE “b_name”;
 *            H5T_IEEE_F64LE “c_name”;
 *         }
 *         DATASPACE SIMPLE { ( 3 ) / ( 3 ) }
 *         DATA {
 *         (0): {
 *                  0,
 *                  0,
 *                  1
 *               },
 *         (1): {
 *                  0,
 *                  1,
 *                  0.5
 *               },
 *         (2): {
 *                  0,
 *                  4,
 *                  0.333333
 *               }
 *            }
 *         }
 *   }
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * It is not necessary to write the whole data at once. Datasets with compound datatypes can be
 * written by field or by subsets of fields. In order to do this one has to remember to set the transfer
 * property of the dataset using the H5Pset_preserve call and to define the memory datatype that
 * corresponds to a field. The example below shows how float and double fields are written to the
 * dataset.
 *
 * <em>Writing floats and doubles to a dataset</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct sb_t {
 *     float b;
 *     double c;
 *   } sb_t;
 *
 *   typedef struct sc_t {
 *     float b;
 *     double c;
 *   } sc_t;
 *   sb_t data1[LENGTH];
 *   sc_t data2[LENGTH];
 *
 *   // Initialize data
 *   for (i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++) {
 *     data1.b = i * i;
 *     data2.c = 1./(i + 1);
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   // Create dataset as in example 15
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   // Create memory datatypes corresponding to float
 *   // and double datatype fields
 *
 *   sb_tid = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(sb_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(sb_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(sb_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
 *   sc_tid = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(sc_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(sc_tid, “c_name”, HOFFSET(sc_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   // Set transfer property
 *   xfer_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_XFER);
 *   H5Pset_preserve(xfer_id, 1);
 *   H5Dwrite (dataset_id, sb_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, xfer_id, data1);
 *   H5Dwrite (dataset_id, sc_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, xfer_id, data2);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The figure below shows the content of the file written on a little-endian machine. Only float and
 * double fields are written. The default fill value is used to initialize the unwritten integer field.
 *
 * <em>Writing floats and doubles to a dataset on a little-endian system</em>

 * <h4>Reading Datasets with Compound Datatypes</h4>
 *
 * Reading datasets with compound datatypes may be a challenge. For general applications there is
 * no way to know a priori the corresponding C structure. Also, C structures cannot be allocated on
 * the fly during discovery of the dataset's datatype. For general C, C++, Fortran and Java
 * application the following steps will be required to read and to interpret data from the dataset with
 * compound datatype:
 * \li 1. Get the identifier of the compound datatype in the file with the #H5Dget_type call
 * \li 2. Find the number of the compound datatype members with the #H5Tget_nmembers call
 * \li 3. Iterate through compound datatype members
 * <ul><li>Get member class with the #H5Tget_member_class call</li>
 * <li>Get member name with the #H5Tget_member_name call</li>
 * <li>Check class type against predefined classes
 * <ul><li>#H5T_INTEGER</li>
 * <li>#H5T_FLOAT</li>
 * <li>#H5T_STRING</li>
 * <li>#H5T_BITFIELD</li>
 * <li>#H5T_OPAQUE</li>
 * <li>#H5T_COMPOUND</li>
 * <li>#H5T_REFERENCE</li>
 * <li>#H5T_ENUM</li>
 * <li>#H5T_VLEN</li>
 * <li>#H5T_ARRAY</li></ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>If class is #H5T_COMPOUND, then go to step 2 and repeat all steps under step 3. If
 * class is not #H5T_COMPOUND, then a member is of an atomic class and can be read
 * to a corresponding buffer after discovering all necessary information specific to each
 * atomic type (for example, size of the integer or floats, super class for enumerated and
 * array datatype, and its sizes)</li></ul>
 *
 * The examples below show how to read a dataset with a known compound datatype.
 *
 * The first example below shows the steps needed to read data of a known structure. First, build a
 * memory datatype the same way it was built when the dataset was created, and then second use
 * the datatype in an #H5Dread call.
 *
 * <em>Read a dataset using a memory datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct s1_t {
 *     int a;
 *     float b;
 *     double c;
 *   } s1_t;
 *
 *   s1_t *data;
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   s1_tid = H5Tcreate(H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(s1_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “a_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, a), H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “c_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dopen(file_id, “SDScompound.h5”, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   data = (s1_t *) malloc (sizeof(s1_t)*LENGTH);
 *   H5Dread(dataset_id, s1_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Instead of building a memory datatype, the application could use the
 * #H5Tget_native_type function. See the example below.
 *
 * <em>Read a dataset using H5Tget_native_type</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct s1_t {
 *     int a;
 *     float b;
 *     double c;
 *   } s1_t;
 *
 *   s1_t *data;
 *   hid_t file_s1_t, mem_s1_t;
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dopen(file_id, “SDScompound.h5”, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *   // Discover datatype in the file
 *   file_s1_t = H5Dget_type(dataset_id);
 *   // Find corresponding memory datatype
 *   mem_s1_t = H5Tget_native_type(file_s1_t, H5T_DIR_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   data = (s1_t *) malloc (sizeof(s1_t)*LENGTH);
 *   H5Dread (dataset_id,mem_s1_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The example below shows how to read just one float member of a compound datatype.
 *
 * <em>Read one floating point member of a compound datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct sf_t {
 *     float b;
 *   } sf_t;
 *
 *   sf_t *data;
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   sf_tid = H5Tcreate(H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(sf_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(sf_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(sf_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dopen(file_id, “SDScompound.h5”, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   data = (sf_t *) malloc (sizeof(sf_t) * LENGTH);
 *   H5Dread(dataset_id, sf_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The example below shows how to read float and double members of a compound datatype into a
 * structure that has those fields in a different order. Please notice that #H5Tinsert calls can be used
 * in an order different from the order of the structure's members.
 *
 * <em>Read float and double members of a compound datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct sdf_t {
 *     double c;
 *     float b;
 *   } sdf_t;
 *
 *   sdf_t *data;
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   sdf_tid = H5Tcreate(H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(sdf_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(sdf_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(sdf_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
 *   H5Tinsert(sdf_tid, “c_name”, HOFFSET(sdf_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dopen(file_id, “SDScompound.h5”, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   data = (sdf_t *) malloc (sizeof(sdf_t) * LENGTH);
 *   H5Dread(dataset_id, sdf_tid, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4>Array</h4>
 *
 * Many scientific datasets have multiple measurements for each point in a space. There are several
 * natural ways to represent this data, depending on the variables and how they are used in
 * computation. See the table and the figure below.

 * The HDF5 #H5T_ARRAY datatype defines the data element to be a homogeneous, multi-dimensional array.
 * See Figure 13 above. The elements of the array can be any HDF5 datatype
 * (including compound and array), and the size of the datatype is the total size of the array. A
 * dataset of array datatype cannot be subdivided for I/O within the data element: the entire array of
 * the data element must be transferred. If the data elements need to be accessed separately, for
 * example, by plane, then the array datatype should not be used. The table below shows
 * advantages and disadvantages of various storage methods.

 * An array datatype may be multi-dimensional with 1 to #H5S_MAX_RANK (the maximum rank
 * of a dataset is currently 32) dimensions. The dimensions can be any size greater than 0, but
 * unlimited dimensions are not supported (although the datatype can be a variable-length datatype).
 *
 * An array datatype is created with the #H5Tarray_create call, which specifies the number of
 * dimensions, the size of each dimension, and the base type of the array. The array datatype can
 * then be used in any way that any datatype object is used. The example below shows the creation
 * of a datatype that is a two-dimensional array of native integers, and this is then used to create a
 * dataset. Note that the dataset can be a dataspace that is any number and size of dimensions. The figure
 * below shows the layout in memory assuming that the native integers are 4 bytes. Each
 * data element has 6 elements, for a total of 24 bytes.
 *
 * <em>Create a two-dimensional array datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t file, dataset;
 *   hid_t datatype, dataspace;
 *   hsize_t adims[] = {3, 2};
 *

 *
 *   dataset = H5Dcreate(file, datasetname, datatype,
 *   dataspace, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);

 *
 * @anchor h4_vlen_datatype <h4>Variable-length Datatypes</h4>
 *
 * A variable-length (VL) datatype is a one-dimensional sequence of a datatype which are not fixed
 * in length from one dataset location to another. In other words, each data element may have a
 * different number of members. Variable-length datatypes cannot be divided; the entire data
 * element must be transferred.
 *
 * VL datatypes are useful to the scientific community in many different ways, possibly including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ragged arrays: Multi-dimensional ragged arrays can be implemented with the last (fastest changing)
 * dimension being ragged by using a VL datatype as the type of the element stored.
 * </li>
 * <li>Fractal arrays: A nested VL datatype can be used to implement ragged arrays of ragged arrays, to
 * whatever nesting depth is required for the user.
 * </li>
 * <li>Polygon lists: A common storage requirement is to efficiently store arrays of polygons with
 * different numbers of vertices. A VL datatype can be used to efficiently and succinctly describe
 * an array of polygons with different numbers of vertices.
 * </li>
 * <li>Character strings: Perhaps the most common use of VL datatypes will be to store C-like VL
 * character strings in dataset elements or as attributes of objects.
 * </li>
 * <li>Indices (for example, of objects within a file): An array of VL object references could be used
 * as an index to all the objects in a file which contain a particular sequence of dataset values.
 * </li>
 * <li>Object Tracking: An array of VL dataset region references can be used as a method of tracking
 * objects or features appearing in a sequence of datasets.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * A VL datatype is created by calling #H5Tvlen_create which specifies the base datatype. The first
 * example below shows an example of code that creates a VL datatype of unsigned integers. Each
 * data element is a one-dimensional array of zero or more members and is stored in the
 * hvl_t structure. See the second example below.
 *
 * <em>Create a variable-length datatype of unsigned integers</em>
 * \code
 *   tid1 = H5Tvlen_create (H5T_NATIVE_UINT);
 *
 *   dataset=H5Dcreate(fid1,“Dataset1”, tid1, sid1, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em>Data element storage for members of the VL datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct
 *   {
 *     size_t len; // Length of VL data
 *                 //(in base type units)
 *     void *p;    // Pointer to VL data
 *   } hvl_t;
 * \endcode
 *
 * The first example below shows how the VL data is written. For each of the 10 data elements, a
 * length and data buffer must be allocated. Below the two examples is a figure that shows how the
 * data is laid out in memory.
 *
 * An analogous procedure must be used to read the data. See the second example below. An
 * appropriate array of hvl_t must be allocated, and the data read. It is then traversed one data
 * element at a time. The #H5Treclaim call frees the data buffer for the buffer. With each
 * element possibly being of different sequence lengths for a dataset with a VL datatype, the
 * memory for the VL datatype must be dynamically allocated. Currently there are two methods of
 * managing the memory for VL datatypes: the standard C malloc/free memory allocation routines
 * or a method of calling user-defined memory management routines to allocate or free memory
 * (set with #H5Pset_vlen_mem_manager). Since the memory allocated when reading (or writing)
 * may be complicated to release, the #H5Treclaim function is provided to traverse a memory
 * buffer and free the VL datatype information without leaking memory.
 *
 * <em>Write VL data</em>
 * \code
 *   hvl_t wdata[10];  // Information to write
 *
 *   // Allocate and initialize VL data to write
 *   for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 *     wdata[i].p = malloc((i + 1) * sizeof(unsigned int));
 *     wdata[i].len = i + 1;
 *     for(j = 0; j < (i + 1); j++)
 *       ((unsigned int *)wdata[i].p)[j]=i * 10 + j;
 *   }
 *   ret = H5Dwrite(dataset, tid1, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, wdata);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em>Read VL data</em>
 * \code
 *   hvl_t rdata[SPACE1_DIM1];
 *   ret = H5Dread(dataset, tid1, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, xfer_pid, rdata);
 *
 *   for(i = 0; i < SPACE1_DIM1; i++) {
 *     printf(“%d: len %d ”,rdata[i].len);
 *     for(j = 0; j < rdata[i].len; j++) {
 *       printf(“ value: %u\n”,((unsigned int *)rdata[i].p)[j]);
 *     }
 *   }
 *   ret = H5Treclaim(tid1, sid1, xfer_pid, rdata);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html Dtypes_fig15.gif "Memory layout of a VL datatype"
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * The user program must carefully manage these relatively complex data structures. The
 * #H5Treclaim function performs a standard traversal, freeing all the data. This function
 * analyzes the datatype and dataspace objects, and visits each VL data element, recursing through
 * nested types. By default, the system free is called for the pointer in each hvl_t. Obviously,
 * this call assumes that all of this memory was allocated with the system malloc.
 *
 * The user program may specify custom memory manager routines, one for allocating and one for
 * freeing. These may be set with the #H5Pset_vlen_mem_manager, and must have the following
 * prototypes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * \code
 * typedef void *(*H5MM_allocate_t)(size_t size, void *info);
 * \endcode
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * \code
 * typedef void (*H5MM_free_t)(void *mem, void *free_info);
 * \endcode
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * The utility function #H5Dvlen_get_buf_size checks the number of bytes required to store the VL
 * data from the dataset. This function analyzes the datatype and dataspace object to visit all the VL
 * data elements, to determine the number of bytes required to store the data for the in the
 * destination storage (memory). The size value is adjusted for data conversion and alignment in the
 * destination.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_other Other Non-numeric Datatypes
 * Several datatype classes define special types of objects.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_strings Strings
 * Text data is represented by arrays of characters, called strings. Many programming languages
 * support different conventions for storing strings, which may be fixed or variable-length, and may
 * have different rules for padding unused storage. HDF5 can represent strings in several ways. See
 * the figure below.
 *
 * The strings to store are “Four score” and “lazy programmers.”
 * <table>
 * <caption>A string stored as one-character elements in a one-dimensional array</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * a) #H5T_NATIVE_CHAR: The dataset is a one-dimensional array with 29 elements, and each element
 * is a single character.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html Dtypes_fig16a.gif
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * b) Fixed-length string: The dataset is a one-dimensional array with two elements, and each
 * element is 20 characters.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html Dtypes_fig16b.gif
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * c) Variable-length string: The dataset is a one-dimensional array with two elements, and each
 * element is a variable-length string. This is the same result when stored as a fixed-length
 * string except that the first element of the array will need only 11 bytes for storage instead of 20.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html Dtypes_fig16c.gif
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html Dtypes_fig16d.gif
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * First, a dataset may have a dataset with datatype #H5T_NATIVE_CHAR with each character of
 * the string as an element of the dataset. This will store an unstructured block of text data, but
 * gives little indication of any structure in the text. See item a in the figure above.
 *
 * A second alternative is to store the data using the datatype class #H5T_STRING with each
 * element a fixed length. See item b in the figure above. In this approach, each element might be a
 * word or a sentence, addressed by the dataspace. The dataset reserves space for the specified
 * number of characters, although some strings may be shorter. This approach is simple and usually
 * is fast to access, but can waste storage space if the length of the Strings varies.
 *
 * A third alternative is to use a variable-length datatype. See item c in the figure above. This can
 * be done using the standard mechanisms described above. The program would use hvl_t structures
 * to write and read the data.
 *
 * A fourth alternative is to use a special feature of the string datatype class to set the size of the
 * datatype to #H5T_VARIABLE. See item c in the figure above. The example below shows a
 * declaration of a datatype of type #H5T_C_S1 which is set to #H5T_VARIABLE. The HDF5
 * Library automatically translates between this and the hvl_t structure. Note: the #H5T_VARIABLE
 * size can only be used with string datatypes.
 *
 * <em>Set the string datatype size to H5T_VARIABLE</em>
 * \code
 *   tid1 = H5Tcopy (H5T_C_S1);
 *   ret = H5Tset_size (tid1, H5T_VARIABLE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Variable-length strings can be read into C strings (in other words, pointers to zero terminated
 * arrays of char). See the example below.
 *
 * <em>Read variable-length strings into C strings</em>
 * \code
 *   char *rdata[SPACE1_DIM1];
 *
 *   ret = H5Dread(dataset, tid1, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, xfer_pid, rdata);
 *
 *   for(i = 0; i < SPACE1_DIM1; i++) {
 *     printf(“%d: len: %d, str is: %s\n”, i, strlen(rdata[i]), rdata[i]);
 *   }
 *
 *   ret = H5Treclaim(tid1, sid1, xfer_pid, rdata);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_refs Reference
 * In HDF5, objects (groups, datasets, attributes, and committed datatypes) are usually accessed by name.
 * There is another way to access stored objects - by reference. Before HDF5 1.12.0, there were only two
 * reference datatypes: object reference and region reference. Since 1.12.0, attribute references and
 * external references were added. And all references can be stored and retrieved from a file by invoking
 * the #H5Dwrite and #H5Dread functions with a single predefined type: #H5T_STD_REF.
 *
 * The first example below shows an example of code that creates
 * references to four objects, and then writes the array of object references to a dataset. The second
 * example below shows a dataset of datatype reference being read and one of the reference objects
 * being dereferenced to obtain an object pointer.
 *
 * <em>Create object references and write to a dataset</em>
 * \code
 *   dataset = H5Dcreate (fid1, “Dataset3”, H5T_STD_REF, sid1, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   // Create reference to dataset
 *   ret = H5Rcreate_object(fid1,“/Group1/Dataset1”, H5R_OBJECT, &wbuf[0]);
 *
 *   // Create reference to dataset
 *   ret = H5Rcreate_object(fid1, “/Group1/Dataset2”, H5R_OBJECT, &wbuf[1]);
 *
 *   // Create reference to group
 *   ret = H5Rcreate_object(fid1, “/Group1”, H5R_OBJECT, &wbuf[2]);
 *
 *   // Create reference to committed datatype
 *   ret = H5Rcreate_object(fid1, “/Group1/Datatype1”, H5R_OBJECT, &wbuf[3]);
 *
 *   // Write selection to disk
 *   ret = H5Dwrite(dataset, H5T_STD_REF, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, wbuf);
 *
 *   // Release buffers
 *       status = H5Rdestroy(&wdata[0]);
 *       status = H5Rdestroy(&wdata[1]);
 *       status = H5Rdestroy(&wdata[2]);
 *       status = H5Rdestroy(&wdata[3]);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em>Read a dataset with a reference datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   rbuf = (H5R_ref_t *)malloc(dims[0] * sizeof(H5R_ref_t));
 *
 *   // Read selection from disk
 *   ret = H5Dread(dataset, H5T_STD_REF, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, rbuf);
 *
 *   // Open dataset object
 *   dset2 = H5Ropen_object(&rbuf[0], H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   // Release buffers
 *   status = H5Rdestroy(&rbuf[0]);
 *   status = H5Rdestroy(&rbuf[1]);
 *   status = H5Rdestroy(&rbuf[2]);
 *   status = H5Rdestroy(&rbuf[3]);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_drefs Deprecated Reference
 * In HDF5, objects (groups, datasets, and committed datatypes) are usually accessed by name.
 * There is another way to access stored objects - by reference. There are two deprecated reference datatypes:
 * object reference and region reference. Object reference objects are created with #H5Rcreate and
 * other calls (cross reference). These objects can be stored and retrieved in a dataset as elements
 * with reference datatype. The first example below shows an example of code that creates
 * references to four objects, and then writes the array of object references to a dataset. The second
 * example below shows a dataset of datatype reference being read and one of the reference objects
 * being dereferenced to obtain an object pointer.
 *
 * In order to store references to regions of a dataset, the datatype should be #H5T_STD_REF_DSETREG.
 * Note that a data element must be either an object reference or a region reference: these are
 * different types and cannot be mixed within a single array.
 *
 * A reference datatype cannot be divided for I/O: an element is read or written completely.
 *
 * <em>Create object references and write to a dataset</em>
 * \code
 *   dataset= H5Dcreate (fid1, “Dataset3”, H5T_STD_REF_OBJ, sid1, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   // Create reference to dataset
 *   ret = H5Rcreate(&wbuf[0], fid1,“/Group1/Dataset1”, H5R_OBJECT, -1);
 *
 *   // Create reference to dataset
 *   ret = H5Rcreate(&wbuf[1], fid1, “/Group1/Dataset2”, H5R_OBJECT, -1);
 *
 *   // Create reference to group

 *
 *   // Create reference to committed datatype
 *   ret = H5Rcreate(&wbuf[3], fid1, “/Group1/Datatype1”, H5R_OBJECT, -1);
 *

 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_enum ENUM
 * The enum datatype implements a set of (name, value) pairs, similar to C/C++ enum. The values
 * are currently limited to native integer datatypes. Each name can be the name of only one value,
 * and each value can have only one name.
 *
 * The data elements of the ENUMERATION are stored according to the datatype. An example
 * would be as an array of integers. The example below shows an example of how to create an
 * enumeration with five elements. The elements map symbolic names to 2-byte integers. See the
 * table below.
 *
 * <em>Create an enumeration with five elements</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t hdf_en_colors;
 *   short val;
 *
 *   hdf_en_colors = H5Tcreate(H5T_ENUM, sizeof(short));
 *   H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, “RED”, (val=0, &val));
 *   H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, “GREEN”, (val=1, &val));
 *   H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, “BLUE”, (val=2, &val));
 *   H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, “WHITE”, (val=3, &val));
 *   H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, “BLACK”, (val=4, &val));
 *   H5Dcreate(fileid, datasetname, hdf_en_colors, spaceid, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>An enumeration with five elements</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Name</th>
 * <th>Value</th>

 * </table>
 *
 * The figure below shows how an array of eight values might be stored. Conceptually, the array is
 * an array of symbolic names [BLACK, RED, WHITE, BLUE, ...] See item a in the figure below.
 * These are stored as the values and are short integers. So, the first 2 bytes are the value associated
 * with “BLACK”, which is the number 4, and so on. See item b in the figure below.
 * <table>

 *
 * The order that members are inserted into an enumeration type is unimportant; the important part
 * is the associations between the symbol names and the values. Thus, two enumeration datatypes
 * will be considered equal if and only if both types have the same symbol/value associations and
 * both have equal underlying integer datatypes. Type equality is tested with the H5Tequal
 * function.
 *
 * If a particular architecture type is required, a little-endian or big-endian datatype for example,
 * use a native integer datatype as the ENUM base datatype and use #H5Tconvert on values as they
 * are read from or written to a dataset.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_opaque Opaque
 * In some cases, a user may have data objects that should be stored and retrieved as blobs with no
 * attempt to interpret them. For example, an application might wish to store an array of encrypted
 * certificates which are 100 bytes long.
 *
 * While an arbitrary block of data may always be stored as bytes, characters, integers, or whatever,
 * this might mislead programs about the meaning of the data. The opaque datatype defines data
 * elements which are uninterpreted by HDF5. The opaque data may be labeled with
 * #H5Tset_tag with a string that might be used by an application. For example, the encrypted
 * certificates might have a tag to indicate the encryption and the certificate standard.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_other_bitfield Bitfield
 * Some data is represented as bits, where the number of bits is not an integral byte and the bits are
 * not necessarily interpreted as a standard type. Some examples might include readings from
 * machine registers (for example, switch positions), a cloud mask, or data structures with several
 * small integers that should be store in a single byte.
 *
 * This data could be stored as integers, strings, or enumerations. However, these storage methods
 * would likely result in considerable wasted space. For example, storing a cloud mask with one
 * byte per value would use up to eight times the space of a packed array of bits.
 *
 * The HDF5 bitfield datatype class defines a data element that is a contiguous sequence of bits,
 * which are stored on disk in a packed array. The programming model is the same as for unsigned
 * integers: the datatype object is created by copying a predefined datatype, and then the precision,
 * offset, and padding are set.
 *
 * While the use of the bitfield datatype will reduce storage space substantially, there will still be
 * wasted space if the bitfield as a whole does not match the 1-, 2-, 4-, or 8-byte unit in which it is
 * written. The remaining unused space can be removed by applying the N-bit filter to the dataset
 * containing the bitfield data. For more information, see "Using the N-bit Filter."
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_fill Fill Values
 * The “fill value” for a dataset is the specification of the default value assigned to data elements
 * that have not yet been written. In the case of a dataset with an atomic datatype, the fill value is a
 * single value of the appropriate datatype, such as ‘0’ or ‘-1.0’. In the case of a dataset with a
 * composite datatype, the fill value is a single data element of the appropriate type. For example,
 * for an array or compound datatype, the fill value is a single data element with values for all the
 * component elements of the array or compound datatype.
 *
 * The fill value is set (permanently) when the dataset is created. The fill value is set in the dataset
 * creation properties in the #H5Dcreate call. Note that the #H5Dcreate call must also include the
 * datatype of the dataset, and the value provided for the fill value will be interpreted as a single
 * element of this datatype. The example below shows code which creates a dataset of integers with
 * fill value -1. Any unwritten data elements will be set to -1.
 *
 * <em>Create a dataset with a fill value of -1</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t plist_id;
 *   int   filler;
 *
 *   filler = -1;
 *   plist_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_CREATE);
 *   H5Pset_fill_value(plist_id, H5T_NATIVE_INT, &filler);
 *
 *   // Create the dataset with fill value ‘-1’.
 *   dataset_id = H5Dcreate(file_id, “/dset”, H5T_STD_I32BE, dataspace_id, H5P_DEFAULT, plist_id,
 *                          H5P_DEFAULT);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em>Create a fill value for a compound datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   typedef struct s1_t {
 *     int a;
 *     char b;
 *     double c;
 *   } s1_t;
 *   s1_t filler;
 *
 *   s1_tid = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof(s1_t));
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “a_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, a), H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “b_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, b), H5T_NATIVE_CHAR);
 *   H5Tinsert(s1_tid, “c_name”, HOFFSET(s1_t, c), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
 *
 *   filler.a = -1;
 *   filler.b = ‘*’;
 *   filler.c = -2.0;
 *   plist_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_CREATE);
 *   H5Pset_fill_value(plist_id, s1_tid, &filler);
 *
 *   // Create the dataset with fill value
 *   // (-1, ‘*’, -2.0).
 *   dataset = H5Dcreate(file, datasetname, s1_tid, space, H5P_DEFAULT, plist_id, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The code above shows how to create a fill value for a compound datatype. The procedure is the
 * same as the previous example except the filler must be a structure with the correct fields. Each
 * field is initialized to the desired fill value.
 *
 * The fill value for a dataset can be retrieved by reading the dataset creation properties of the
 * dataset and then by reading the fill value with #H5Pget_fill_value. The data will be read into
 * memory using the storage layout specified by the datatype. This transfer will convert data in the
 * same way as #H5Dread. The example below shows how to get the fill value from the dataset
 * created in the example "Create a dataset with a fill value of -1".
 *
 * <em>Retrieve a fill value</em>
 * \code
 *   hid_t plist2;
 *   int   filler;
 *
 *   dataset_id = H5Dopen(file_id, “/dset”, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *   plist2 = H5Dget_create_plist(dataset_id);
 *
 *   H5Pget_fill_value(plist2, H5T_NATIVE_INT, &filler);
 *
 *   // filler has the fill value, ‘-1’
 * \endcode
 *
 * A similar procedure is followed for any datatype. The example below shows how to read the fill
 * value for the compound datatype created in an example above. Note that the program must pass
 * an element large enough to hold a fill value of the datatype indicated by the argument to
 * #H5Pget_fill_value. Also, the program must understand the datatype in order to interpret its
 * components. This may be difficult to determine without knowledge of the application that
 * created the dataset.
 *
 * <em>Read the fill value for a compound datatype</em>
 * \code
 *   char *fillbuf;
 *   int   sz;
 *
 *   dataset = H5Dopen( file, DATASETNAME, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   s1_tid = H5Dget_type(dataset);
 *
 *   sz = H5Tget_size(s1_tid);
 *
 *   fillbuf = (char *)malloc(sz);
 *
 *   plist_id = H5Dget_create_plist(dataset);
 *
 *   H5Pget_fill_value(plist_id, s1_tid, fillbuf);
 *
 *   printf(“filler.a: %d\n”,((s1_t *) fillbuf)->a);
 *   printf(“filler.b: %c\n”,((s1_t *) fillbuf)->b);
 *   printf(“filler.c: %f\n”,((s1_t *) fillbuf)->c);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_complex Complex Combinations of Datatypes
 * Several composite datatype classes define collections of other datatypes, including other
 * composite datatypes. In general, a datatype can be nested to any depth, with any combination of
 * datatypes.
 *
 * For example, a compound datatype can have members that are other compound datatypes, arrays,
 * VL datatypes. An array can be an array of array, an array of compound, or an array of VL. And a
 * VL datatype can be a variable-length array of compound, array, or VL datatypes.
 *
 * These complicated combinations of datatypes form a logical tree, with a single root datatype, and
 * leaves which must be atomic datatypes (predefined or user-defined). The figure below shows an
 * example of a logical tree describing a compound datatype constructed from different datatypes.
 *
 * Recall that the datatype is a description of the layout of storage. The complicated compound
 * datatype is constructed from component datatypes, each of which describes the layout of part of
 * the storage. Any datatype can be used as a component of a compound datatype, with the
 * following restrictions:
 * <ul><li>1. No byte can be part of more than one component datatype (in other words, the fields cannot
 * overlap within the compound datatype)</li>
 * <li>2. The total size of the components must be less than or equal to the total size of the compound
 * datatype</li></ul>
 * These restrictions are essentially the rules for C structures and similar record types familiar from
 * programming languages. Multiple typing, such as a C union, is not allowed in HDF5 datatypes.

 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_complex_create Creating a Complicated Compound Datatype
 * To construct a complicated compound datatype, each component is constructed, and then added
 * to the enclosing datatype description. The example below shows how to create a compound
 * datatype with four members:
 * \li “T1”, a compound datatype with three members
 * \li “T2”, a compound datatype with two members
 * \li “T3”, a one-dimensional array of integers
 * \li “T4”, a string
 *
 * Below the example code is a figure that shows this datatype as a logical tree. The output of the
 * h5dump utility is shown in the example below the figure.
 *
 * Each datatype is created as a separate datatype object. Figure "The storage layout for the
 * four member datatypes" below shows the storage layout
 * for the four individual datatypes. Then the datatypes are inserted into the outer datatype at an
 * appropriate offset. Figure "The storage layout of the combined four members" below shows the
 * resulting storage layout. The combined record is 89 bytes long.
 *
 * The Dataset is created using the combined compound datatype. The dataset is declared to be a 4
 * by 3 array of compound data. Each data element is an instance of the 89-byte compound
 * datatype. Figure "The layout of the dataset" below shows the layout of the dataset, and expands
 * one of the elements to show the relative position of the component data elements.
 *
 * Each data element is a compound datatype, which can be written or read as a record, or each
 * field may be read or written individually. The first field (“T1”) is itself a compound datatype
 * with three fields (“T1.a”, “T1.b”, and “T1.c”). “T1” can be read or written as a record, or
 * individual fields can be accessed. Similarly, the second filed is a compound datatype with two
 * fields (“T2.f1”, “T2.f2”).
 *
 * The third field (“T3”) is an array datatype. Thus, “T3” should be accessed as an array of 40
 * integers. Array data can only be read or written as a single element, so all 40 integers must be
 * read or written to the third field. The fourth field (“T4”) is a single string of length 25.

 * \subsubsection subsubsec_datatype_complex_analyze Analyzing and Navigating a Compound Datatype
 * A complicated compound datatype can be analyzed piece by piece to discover the exact storage
 * layout. In the example above, the outer datatype is analyzed to discover that it is a compound
 * datatype with four members. Each member is analyzed in turn to construct a complete map of the
 * storage layout.
 *
 * The example below shows an example of code that partially analyzes a nested compound
 * datatype. The name and overall offset and size of the component datatype is discovered, and then
 * its type is analyzed depending on the datatype class. Through this method, the complete storage
 * layout can be discovered.

 *
 * \subsection subsec_datatype_life Life Cycle of the Datatype Object
 * Application programs access HDF5 datatypes through identifiers. Identifiers are obtained by
 * creating a new datatype or by copying or opening an existing datatype. The identifier can be used
 * until it is closed or until the library shuts down. See items a and b in the figure below. By default,
 * a datatype is transient, and it disappears when it is closed.
 *
 * When a dataset or attribute is created (#H5Dcreate or #H5Acreate), its datatype is stored in the
 * HDF5 file as part of the dataset or attribute object. See item c in the figure below. Once an object
 * created, its datatype cannot be changed or deleted. The datatype can be accessed by calling
 * #H5Dget_type, #H5Aget_type, #H5Tget_super, or #H5Tget_member_type. See item d in the figure
 * below. These calls return an identifier to a transient copy of the datatype of the dataset or
 * attribute unless the datatype is a committed datatype.
 * Note that when an object is created, the stored datatype is a copy of the transient datatype. If two
 * objects are created with the same datatype, the information is stored in each object with the same
 * effect as if two different datatypes were created and used.
 *
 * A transient datatype can be stored using #H5Tcommit in the HDF5 file as an independent, named
 * object, called a committed datatype. Committed datatypes were formerly known as named
 * datatypes. See item e in the figure below. Subsequently, when a committed datatype is opened
 * with #H5Topen (item f), or is obtained with #H5Tget_member_type or similar call (item k), the return
 * is an identifier to a transient copy of the stored datatype. The identifier can be used in the
 * same way as other datatype identifiers except that the committed datatype cannot be modified. When a
 * committed datatype is copied with #H5Tcopy, the return is a new, modifiable, transient datatype
 * object (item f).
 *
 * When an object is created using a committed datatype (#H5Dcreate, #H5Acreate), the stored
 * datatype is used without copying it to the object. See item j in the figure below. In this case, if
 * multiple objects are created using the same committed datatype, they all share the exact same
 * datatype object. This saves space and makes clear that the datatype is shared. Note that a
 * committed datatype can be shared by objects within the same HDF5 file, but not by objects in
 * other files. For more information on copying committed datatypes to other HDF5 files, see the
 * “Copying Committed Datatypes with H5Ocopy” topic in the “Additional Resources” chapter.
 *
 * A committed datatype can be deleted from the file by calling #H5Ldelete which replaces
 * #H5Gunlink. See item i in the figure below. If one or more objects are still using the datatype, the
 * committed datatype cannot be accessed with #H5Topen, but will not be removed from the file
 * until it is no longer used. #H5Tget_member_type and similar calls will return a transient copy of the
 * datatype.

 *
 * Transient datatypes are initially modifiable. Note that when a datatype is copied or when it is
 * written to the file (when an object is created) or the datatype is used to create a composite
 * datatype, a copy of the current state of the datatype is used. If the datatype is then modified, the
 * changes have no effect on datasets, attributes, or datatypes that have already been created. See
 * the figure below.
 *
 * A transient datatype can be made read-only (#H5Tlock). Note that the datatype is still transient,
 * and otherwise does not change. A datatype that is immutable is read-only but cannot be closed
 * except when the entire library is closed. The predefined types such as #H5T_NATIVE_INT are
 * immutable transient types.

 * \subsection subsec_datatype_transfer Data Transfer: Datatype Conversion and Selection
 * When data is transferred (write or read), the storage layout of the data elements may be different.
 * For example, an integer might be stored on disk in big-endian byte order and read into memory
 * with little-endian byte order. In this case, each data element will be transformed by the HDF5
 * Library during the data transfer.
 *
 * The conversion of data elements is controlled by specifying the datatype of the source and
 * specifying the intended datatype of the destination. The storage format on disk is the datatype
 * specified when the dataset is created. The datatype of memory must be specified in the library
 * call.
 *
 * In order to be convertible, the datatype of the source and destination must have the same
 * datatype class (with the exception of enumeration type). Thus, integers can be converted to other
 * integers, and floats to other floats, but integers cannot (yet) be converted to floats. For each
 * atomic datatype class, the possible conversions are defined. An enumeration datatype can be
 * converted to an integer or a floating-point number datatype.
 *
 * Basically, any datatype can be converted to another datatype of the same datatype class. The
 * HDF5 Library automatically converts all properties. If the destination is too small to hold the
 * source value then an overflow or underflow exception occurs. If a handler is defined with the
 * #H5Pset_type_conv_cb function, it will be called. Otherwise, a default action will be performed.
 * The table below summarizes the default actions.
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>Default actions for datatype conversion exceptions</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Datatype Class</th>
 * <th>Possible Exceptions</th>
 * <th>Default Action</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Integer</td>
 * <td>Size, offset, pad</td>
 * <td></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Float</td>
 * <td>Size, offset, pad, ebits</td>
 * <td></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>String</td>
 * <td>Size</td>
 * <td>Truncates, zero terminate if required.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Enumeration</td>
 * <td>No field</td>
 * <td>All bits set</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * For example, when reading data from a dataset, the source datatype is the datatype set when the
 * dataset was created, and the destination datatype is the description of the storage layout in
 * memory. The destination datatype must be specified in the #H5Dread call. The example below
 * shows an example of reading a dataset of 32-bit integers. The figure below the example shows
 * the data transformation that is performed.
 *
 * <em>Specify the destination datatype with H5Dread</em>
 * \code
 *   // Stored as H5T_STD_BE32
 *   // Use the native memory order in the destination
 *   mem_type_id = H5Tcopy(H5T_NATIVE_INT);
 *   status = H5Dread(dataset_id, mem_type_id, mem_space_id, file_space_id, xfer_plist_id, buf);
 * \endcode

 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * One thing to note in the example above is the use of the predefined native datatype
 * #H5T_NATIVE_INT. Recall that in this example, the data was stored as a 4-bytes in big-endian
 * order. The application wants to read this data into an array of integers in memory. Depending on
 * the system, the storage layout of memory might be either big or little-endian, so the data may
 * need to be transformed on some platforms and not on others. The #H5T_NATIVE_INT type is set
 * by the HDF5 Library to be the correct type to describe the storage layout of the memory on the
 * system. Thus, the code in the example above will work correctly on any platform, performing a
 * transformation when needed.
 *
 * There are predefined native types for most atomic datatypes, and these can be combined in
 * composite datatypes. In general, the predefined native datatypes should always be used for data
 * stored in memory.
 * Predefined native datatypes describe the storage properties of memory.

 * \subsection subsec_datatype_text Text Descriptions of Datatypes: Conversion to and from
 *
 * HDF5 provides a means for generating a portable and human-readable text description of a
 * datatype and for generating a datatype from such a text description. This capability is particularly
 * useful for creating complex datatypes in a single step, for creating a text description of a datatype
 * for debugging purposes, and for creating a portable datatype definition that can then be used to
 * recreate the datatype on many platforms or in other applications.
 *
 * These tasks are handled by two functions provided in the HDF5 Lite high-level library:
 * \li #H5LTtext_to_dtype Creates an HDF5 datatype in a single step.
 * \li #H5LTdtype_to_text Translates an HDF5 datatype into a text description.
 *
 * Note that this functionality requires that the HDF5 High-Level Library (H5LT) be installed.
 *
 * While #H5LTtext_to_dtype can be used to generate any sort of datatype, it is particularly useful
 * for complex datatypes.
 *
 * #H5LTdtype_to_text is most likely to be used in two sorts of situations: when a datatype must be
 * closely examined for debugging purpose or to create a portable text description of the datatype
 * that can then be used to recreate the datatype on other platforms or in other applications.
 *
 * These two functions work for all valid HDF5 datatypes except time, bitfield, and reference
 * datatypes.
 *
 * The currently supported text format used by #H5LTtext_to_dtype and #H5LTdtype_to_text is the
 * data description language (DDL) and conforms to the \ref DDLBNF114. The portion of the
 * \ref DDLBNF114 that defines HDF5 datatypes appears below.
