More Possible Info for H5ES_op_info_t:
    Parent Operation's request token (*) -> "parent event count"? -- Could be
        used to "prune" child operations from reported errors, with flag
        to H5ESget_err_info?

Possible debugging routines:  (Should also be configured from Env Var)
    H5ESdebug_signal(hid_t es_id, signal_t sig, uint64_t <event count>);
    H5ESdebug_err_trace_log(hid_t es_id, const char *filename);
    H5ESdebug_err_trace_fh(hid_t es_id, FILE *fh);
    H5ESdebug_err_signal(hid_t es_id, signal_t sig);
[Possibly option to allow operations to be inserted into event set with error?]

    Example usage:
        es_id = H5EScreate();
        H5ESdebug...(es_id, ...);
        ...
        H5Dwrite_async(..., es_id);
