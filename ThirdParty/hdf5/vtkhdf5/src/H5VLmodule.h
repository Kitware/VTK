 *
 * \section sec_vol The HDF5 Virtual Object Layer (VOL)
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_intro Introduction
 * The virtual object layer is an abstraction layer in the HDF5 library that intercepts all API calls
 * that could potentially access objects in an HDF5 container and forwards those calls to a VOL
 * connector, which implements the storage. The user or application gets the benefit of using the
 * familiar and widely-used HDF5 data model and API, but can map the physical storage of the HDF5 file
 * and objects to storage that better meets the application's data needs.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_abstract_layer The VOL Abstraction Layer
 * The VOL lies just under the public API. When a storage-oriented public APIcall is made, the library
 * performs a few sanity checks on the input parameters and then immediately invokes a VOL callback,
 * which resolves to an implementation in the VOL connector that was selected when opening or creating
 * the file. The VOL connector then performs whatever operations are needed before control returns to the
 * library, where any final library operations such as assigning IDs for newly created/opened datasets are
 * performed before returning. This means that, for calls that utilize the VOL, all of the functionality
 * is deferred to the VOL connector and the HDF5 library does very little work. An important consideration
 * of this is that most of the HDF5 caching layers (metadata and chunk caches, page buffering, etc.) will
 * not be available as those are implemented in the HDF5 native VOL connector and cannot be easily reused
 * by external connectors.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td>
 * \image html vol_architecture.png "The VOL Architecture"
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Not all public HDF5 API calls pass through the VOL. Only calls which require manipulating storage go
 * through the VOL and require a VOL connector author to implement the appropriate callback. Dataspace,
 * property list, error stack, etc. calls have nothing to do with storage manipulation or querying and
 * do not use the VOL. This may be confusing when it comes to property list calls, since many of those
 * calls set properties for storage. Property lists are just collections of key-value pairs, though, so
 * a particular VOL connector is not required to set or get properties.
 *
 * Another thing to keep in mind is that not every VOL connector will implement the full HDF5 public API.
 * In some cases, a particular feature like variable-length types may not have been developed yet or may
 * not have an equivalent in the target storage system. Also, many HDF5 public API calls are specific to
 * the native HDF5 file format and are unlikely to have any use in other VOL connectors. A
 * feature/capabilities flag scheme is being developed to help navigate this.
 *
 * For more information about which calls go through the VOL and the mechanism by which this is implemented,
 * see the connector author and library internals documentation.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_connect VOL Connectors
 * A VOL connector can be implemented in several ways:
 * \li as a shared or static library linked to an application
 * \li as a dynamically loaded plugin, implemented as a shared library
 * \li and even as an internal connector, built into the HDF5 library itself
 *
 * This section mostly focuses on external connectors, both libraries and plugins, as those are expected
 * to be much more common than internal implementations.
 *
 * A list of VOL connectors can be found here:
 * <a href="https://\DOCURL/registered_vol_connectors.md">
 * Registered VOL Connectors</a>
 *
 * This list is incomplete and only includes the VOL connectors that have been registered with
 * The HDF Group.
 *
 * Not every connector in this collection is actively maintained by The HDF Group. It simply serves as a
 * single location where important VOL connectors can be found. See the documentation in a connector's
 * repository to determine its development status and the parties responsible for it.
 *
 * A VOL template that contains build scripts (Autotools and CMake) and an empty VOL connector "shell"
 * which can be copied and used as a starting point for building new connectors is located here:
 * <a href="https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-template">VOL Connector Template</a>
 *
 * This template VOL connector is for use in constructing terminal VOL connectors that do not forward
 * calls to an underlying connector. The external pass-through VOL connector listed on the registered
 * connector page can be used as a starting point for pass-through connectors.
 *
 * The only current (non-test) internal VOL connector distributed with the library is the native file
 * format connector (the "native VOL connector") which contains the code that handles native HDF5 (*.h5/hdf5)
 * files. In other words, even the canonical HDF5 file format is implemented via the VOL, making it a core
 * part of the HDF5 library and not an optional component which could be disabled.
 *
 * It has not been completely abstracted from the HDF5 library, though, and is treated as a special case.
 * For example, it cannot be unloaded and is always present.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_quickstart Quickstart
 * The following steps summarize how one would go about using a VOL connector
 * with an application. More information on particular steps can be found later
 * on in this document.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_read Read The Documentation For The New VOL Connector
 * Many VOL connectors will require specific setup and configuration of both the application and the
 * storage. Specific permissions may have to be set, configuration files constructed, and
 * connector-specific setup calls may need to be invoked in the application. In many cases, converting
 * software to use a new VOL connector will be more than just a straightforward drop-in replacement done by
 * specifying a name in the VOL plugin environment variable.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_use Use A VOL-Enabled HDF5 Library
 * The virtual object layer was introduced in HDF5 1.12.0, however that version of the VOL is deprecated
 * due to inadequate support for pass-through connectors. These deficiencies have been addressed
 * in HDF5 1.14.0, so VOL users and connector authors should target the 1.14.0 VOL API.
 *
 * On Windows, it's probably best to use the same debug vs release configuration for the application and
 * all libraries in order to avoid C runtime (CRT) issues. Pre-2015 versions of Visual Studio are not
 * supported.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_set Determine How You Will Set The VOL Connector
 * Fundamentally, setting a VOL connector involves modifying the file access property list (fapl) that will
 * be used to open or create the file.
 *
 * There are essentially three ways to do this:
 * \li Direct use of \ref H5Pset_vol()
 * \li Library-specific API calls that call \ref H5Pset_vol() for you
 * \li Use the VOL environment variable, which will also call \ref H5Pset_vol() for you
 *
 * Exactly how you go about setting a VOL connector in a fapl, will depend on
 * the complexity of the VOL connector and how much control you have over the
 * application's source code. Note that the environment variable method, though
 * convenient, has some limitations in its implementation, which are discussed
 * below.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_update If Needed: Update Your Code To Load And Use A VOL Connector
 * There are two concerns when modifying the application:
 * <ul><li> It may be convenient to add connector-specific setup calls to the application.</li>
 * <li> You will also need to protect any API calls which are only implemented in
 * the native VOL connector as those calls will fail when using a non-native
 * VOL connector. See the section \ref subsec_vol_adapt, below.
 * A list of native VOL API calls has been included in \ref subsubsec_vol_compat_native.</li></ul>
 *
 * In some cases, using the VOL environment variable will work well for setting the
 * connector and any associated storage setup and the application will not use API
 * calls that are not supported by the VOL connector. In this case, no application
 * modification will be necessary.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_plugin If Using A Plugin: Make Sure The VOL Connector Is In The Search
 * Path The default location for all HDF5 plugins is set at configure time when building the HDF5 library.
 * This is true for both CMake and the Autotools. The default locations for the plugins on both Windows and
 * POSIX systems is listed further on in this document.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_quick_opt Optional: Set The VOL Connector Via The Environment Variable
 * In place of modifying the source code of your application, you may be able
 * to simply set the #HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR environment variable (see below). This
 * will automatically use the specified VOL in place of the native VOL connector.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_use Connector Use
 * Before a VOL connector can be set in a fapl, it must be registered with the
 * library (\ref H5Pset_vol requires the connector's #hid_t ID) and, if a plugin, it
 * must be discoverable by the library at run time.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_register Registration
 * Before a connector can be used, it must be registered. This loads the connector
 * into the library and give it an HDF5 hid_t ID. The \ref H5VLregister_connector
 * API calls are used for this.
 * \code
 *    hid_t H5VLregister_connector_by_name(const char *connector_name, hid_t vipl_id)
 *    hid_t H5VLregister_connector_by_value(H5VL_class_value_t connector_value, hid_t vipl_id)
 * \endcode
 * When used with a plugin, these functions will check to see if an appropriate
 * plugin with a matching name, value, etc. is already loaded and check the plugin
 * path (see above) for matching plugins if this is not true. The functions return
 * #H5I_INVALID_HID if they are unable to register the connector. Many VOL connectors will provide
 * a connector-specific init call that will load and register the
 * connector for you.
 *
 * Note the two ways that a VOL connector can be identified: by a name or by
 * a connector-specific numerical value (#H5VL_class_value_t is typedef’d to an
 * integer). The name and value for a connector can be found in the connector's
 * documentation or public header file.
 *
 * Each call also takes a VOL initialization property list (vipl). The library adds
 * no properties to this list, so it is entirely for use by connector authors. Set this
 * to #H5P_DEFAULT unless instructed differently by the documentation for the VOL
 * connector.
 *
 * As far as the library is concerned, connectors do not need to be explicitly unregistered as the
 * library will unload the plugin and close the ID when the library is
 * closed. If you want to close a VOL connector ID, either \ref H5VLunregister_connector()
 * or \ref H5VLclose() can be used (they have the same internal code path). The library maintains a
 * reference count on all open IDs and will not do the actual
 * work of closing an ID until its reference count drops to zero, so it's safe to close
 * IDs anytime after they are used, even while an HDF5 file that was opened with
 * that connector is still open.
 *
 * Note that it's considered an error to unload the native VOL connector. The
 * library will prevent this. This means that, for the time being, the native VOL
 * connector will always be available. This may change in the future so that
 * the memory footprint of the native VOL connector goes away when not in
 * use.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_version Connector Versioning
 * The VOL connector struct provides a \b conn_version field for versioning connectors. The library
 * developers are working on some best practices for versioning connectors.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_reg_calls Connector-Specific Registration Calls
 * Most connectors will provide a special API call which will set the connector
 * in the fapl. These will often be in the form of \b H5Pset_fapl_<name>(). For
 * example, the <a href="https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-daos">DAOS VOL</a> connector
 * provides a \b H5Pset_fapl_daos() API call which will take MPI parameters and
 * make this call. See the connector's documentation or public header file(s) for
 * more information.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_set_vol H5Pset_vol()
 * The is the main library API call for setting the VOL connector in a file access
 * property list. Its signature is:
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Pset_vol(hid_t plist_id, hid_t new_vol_id, const void new_vol_info)
 * \endcode
 *
 * It takes the ID of the file access property list, the ID of the registered VOL
 * connector, and a pointer to whatever connector-specific data the connector is
 * expecting. This will usually be a data struct specified in the connector's header
 * or a NULL pointer if the connecter requires no special information (as in the
 * native VOL connector).
 *
 * As mentioned above, many connectors will provide their own replacement for
 * this call. See the connector's documentation for more information.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_search VOL Connector Search Path
 * Dynamically loaded VOL connector plugins are discovered and loaded by the
 * library using the same mechanism as dataset/group filter plugins. The default
 * locations are:
 *
 * <em>Default locations</em>
 * \code
 *     POSIX systems: /usr/local/hdf5/lib/plugin
 *     Windows: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%/hdf5/lib/plugin
 * \endcode
 *
 * These default locations can be overridden by setting the #HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH
 * environment variable. There are also public H5PL API calls which can be used
 * to add, modify, and remove search paths. The library will only look for plugins
 * in the specified plugin paths. By default, it will NOT find plugins that are
 * simply located in the same directory as the executable.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_param Parameter Strings
 * Each VOL connector is allowed to take in a parameter string which can be
 * parsed via \ref H5VLconnector_str_to_info() to get an info struct which can be
 * passed to \ref H5Pset_vol().
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5VLconnector_str_to_info(const char *str, hid_t connector_id, void **info)
 * \endcode
 *
 * And the obtained info can be freed via:
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5VLfree_connector_info(hid_t connector_id, void *vol_info)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Most users will not need this functionality as they will be using either connector-
 * specific setup calls which will handle registering and configuring the connector
 * for them or they will be using the environment variable (see below).
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_connect_env Environment Variable
 * The HDF5 library allows specifying a default VOL connector via an environment
 * variable: #HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR. The value of this environment variable should
 * be set to ”<em>vol connector name \<parameters\></em>”.
 *
 * This will perform the equivalent of:
 * <ol>
 * <li> \ref H5VLregister_connector_by_name() using the specified connector name</li>
 * <li> \ref H5VLconnector_str_to_info() using the specified parameters. This will
 * go through the connector we got from the previous step and should return
 * a VOL info struct from the parameter string in the environment variable.</li>
 * <li> \ref H5Pset_vol() on the default fapl using the obtained ID and info.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The environment variable is parsed once, at library startup. Since the environment variable scheme
 * just changes the default connector, it can be overridden
 * by subsequent calls to \ref H5Pset_vol(). The <em>\<parameters\></em> is optional, so for
 * connectors which do not require any special configuration parameters you can
 * just set the environment variable to the name.
 *
 * NOTE: Implementing the environment variable in this way means that setting
 * the native VOL connector becomes somewhat awkward as there is no explicit
 * HDF5 API call to do this. Instead you will need to get the native VOL connector's ID via
 * \ref H5VLget_connector_id_by_value(#H5_VOL_NATIVE) and set it manually in the fapl
 * using \ref H5Pset_vol().
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_adapt Adapting HDF5 Software to Use the VOL
 * The VOL was engineered to be as unobtrusive as possible and, when a connector
 * which implements most/all of the data model functionality is in use, many applications
 * will require little, if any, modification. As mentioned in the quick start
 * section, most modifications will probably consist of connector setup code (which
 * can usually be accomplished via the environment variable), adapting code to use
 * the new token-based API calls, and protecting native-VOL-connector-specific
 * functions.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_adapt_token haddr_t → H5O_token_t
 * Some HDF5 API calls and data structures refer to addresses in the HDF5 using
 * the #haddr_t type. Unfortunately, the concept of an ”address” will make no
 * sense for many connectors, though they may still have some sort of location key
 * (e.g.: a key in a key-value pair store).
 *
 * As a part of the VOL work, the HDF5 API was updated to replace the #haddr_t
 * type with a new #H5O_token_t type that represents a more generic object location.
 * These tokens appear as an opaque byte array of #H5O_MAX_TOKEN_SIZE bytes
 * that is only meaningful for a particular VOL connector. They are not intended
 * for interpretation outside of a VOL connector, though a connector author may
 * provide an API call to convert their tokens to something meaningful for the
 * storage.
 * \code
 *     typedef struct H5O_token_t {
 *         uint8_t __data[H5O_MAX_TOKEN_SIZE];
 *     } H5O_token_t;
 * \endcode
 *
 * As an example, in the native VOL connector, the token stores an #haddr_t address and
 * addresses can be converted to and from tokens using #H5VLnative_addr_to_token()
 * and #H5VLnative_token_to_addr().
 *
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5VLnative_addr_to_token(hid_t loc_id, haddr_t addr, H5O_token_t *token)
 *     herr_t H5VLnative_token_to_addr(hid_t loc_id, H5O_token_t token, haddr_t *addr)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Several API calls have also been added to compare tokens and convert tokens
 * to and from strings.
 *
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Otoken_cmp(hid_t loc_id, const H5O_token_t *token1, const H5O_token_t *token2,
 *                         int *cmp_value)
 *     herr_t H5Otoken_to_str(hid_t loc_id, const H5O_token_t *token, char **token_str)
 *     herr_t H5Otoken_from_str(hid_t loc_id, const char *token_str, H5O_token_t *token)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_adapt_api Specific API Call Substitutions
 * <h4>H5Fis_hdf5() → H5Fis_accessible()</h4>
 * \ref H5Fis_hdf5() does not take a file access property list (fapl). As this is where the
 * VOL connector is specified, this call cannot be used with arbitrary connectors.
 * As a VOL-enabled replacement, \ref H5Fis_accessible() has been added to the
 * library. It has the same semantics as \ref H5Fis_hdf5(), but takes a fapl so it can
 * work with any VOL connector.
 *
 * Note that, at this time, \ref H5Fis_hdf5() always uses the native VOL connector,
 * regardless of the settings of environment variables, etc.
 * \code
 *     htri_t H5Fis_accessible(const char *container_name, hid_t fapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note also that an error is only returned if it is not possible to determine
 * if a file (or container) is accessible.  It is not an error to return 'false'
 * for whether the file is accessible.
 *
 * <h4> H5Oget_info[1|2]() → H5Oget_info3() and H5Oget_native_info()</h4>
 * The \ref H5Oget_info1() and \ref H5Oget_info2() family of HDF5 API calls are often
 * used by user code to obtain information about an object in the file, however
 * these calls returned a struct which contained native information and are thus
 * unsuitable for use with arbitrary VOL connectors.
 *
 * A new \ref H5Oget_info3() family of API calls has been added to the library which
 * only return data model information via a new \ref H5O_info2_t struct. This struct
 * also returns #H5O_token_t tokens in place of #haddr_t addresses.
 * \code
 *     H5Oget_info3(hid_t loc_id, H5O_info2_t *oinfo, unsigned fields)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Oget_info_by_name3(hid_t loc_id, const char *name, H5O_info2_t *oinfo,
 *                                 unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id)
 *     herr_t H5Oget_info_by_idx3(hid_t loc_id, const char *group_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                                H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t n, H5O_info2_t *oinfo,
 *                                unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 *     typedef struct H5O_info2_t {
 *         unsigned long fileno; // File number that object is located in
 *         H5O_token_t token;    // Token representing the object
 *         H5O_type_t type;      // Basic object type (group, dataset, etc.)
 *         unsigned rc;          // Reference count of object
 *         time_t atime;         // Access time
 *         time_t mtime;         // Modification time
 *         time_t ctime;         // Change time
 *         time_t btime;         // Birth time
 *         hsize_t num_attrs;    // # of attributes attached to object
 *     } H5O_info2_t;
 * \endcode
 *
 * To return the native file format information, \ref H5Oget_native_info() calls have
 * been added which can return such data separate from the data model data.
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Oget_native_info(hid_t loc_id, H5O_native_info_t *oinfo, unsigned fields)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Oget_native_info_by_name(hid_t loc_id, const char *name, H5O_native_info_t *oinfo,
 *                                       unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Oget_native_info_by_idx(hid_t loc_id, const char *group_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                                      H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t n, H5O_native_info_t *oinfo,
 *                                      unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 *     typedef struct H5O_native_info_t {
 *         H5O_hdr_info_t hdr; // Object header information
 *         // Extra metadata storage for obj & attributes
 *         struct {
 *             H5_ih_info_t obj;  // v1/v2 B-tree & local/fractal heap for groups,
 *                                // B-tree for chunked datasets
 *             H5_ih_info_t attr; // v2 B-tree & heap for attributes
 *         } meta_size;
 *     } H5O_native_info_t;
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4>H5Ovisit[1|2]() → H5Ovisit3()</h4>
 * The callback used in the \ref H5Ovisit() family of API calls took an H5O info t
 * struct parameter. As in \ref H5Oget_info(), this both commingled data model and
 * native file format information and also used native HDF5 file addresses.
 *
 * New \ref H5Ovisit3() API calls have been created which use the token-based, data-model-only
 * #H5O_info_t struct in the callback.
 *
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Ovisit3(hid_t obj_id, H5_index_t idx_type, H5_iter_order_t order, H5O_iterate2_t op,
 *                      void *op_data, unsigned fields)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Ovisit_by_name3(hid_t loc_id, const char *obj_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                              H5_iter_order_t order, H5O_iterate2_t op, void *op_data,
 *                              unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 *     typedef herr_t (*H5O_iterate2_t)(hid_t obj, const char *name, const H5O_info2_t *info, void *op_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4>H5Lget_info() → H5Lget_info2()</h4>
 * The \ref H5Lget_info() API calls were updated to use tokens instead of addresses
 * in the #H5L_info_t struct.
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Lget_info2(hid_t loc_id, const char *name, H5L_info2_t *linfo, hid_t lapl_id)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Lget_info_by_idx2(hid_t loc_id, const char *group_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                                H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t n, H5L_info2_t *linfo, hid_t lapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 *     typedef struct {
 *         H5L_type_t type;      // Type of link
 *         bool corder_valid; // Indicate if creation order is valid
 *         int64_t corder;       // Creation order
 *         H5T_cset_t cset;      // Character set of link name
 *         union {
 *             H5O_token_t token; // Token of location that hard link points to
 *             size_t val_size;   // Size of a soft link or UD link value
 *         } u;
 *     } H5L_info2_t;
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4>H5Literate() and H5Lvisit() → H5Literate2() and H5Lvisit2()</h4>
 * The callback used in these API calls used the old #H5L_info_t struct, which used
 * addresses instead of tokens. These callbacks were versioned in the C library and
 * now take modified #H5L_iterate2_t callbacks which use the new token-based info
 * structs.
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5Literate2(hid_t grp_id, H5_index_t idx_type, H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t *idx,
 *                        H5L_iterate2_t op, void *op_data)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Literate_by_name2(hid_t loc_id, const char *group_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                                H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t *idx, H5L_iterate2_t op,
 *                                void *op_data, hid_t lapl_id)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Lvisit2(hid_t grp_id, H5_index_t idx_type, H5_iter_order_t order, H5L_iterate2_t op,
 *                      void *op_data)
 *
 *     herr_t H5Lvisit_by_name2(hid_t loc_id, const char *group_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
 *                              H5_iter_order_t order, H5L_iterate2_t op, void *op_data, hid_t lapl_id)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 *     typedef herr_t (*H5L_iterate2_t)(hid_t group, const char *name, const H5L_info2_t *info,
 *                                      void *op_data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4> H5Oopen by addr() → H5Oopen by token()</h4>
 * The new \ref H5Oopen_by_token() API call can be used to open objects by the
 * tokens that are returned by the various ”get info”, et al. API calls.
 * \code
 *     hid_t H5Oopen_by_token(hid_t loc_id, H5O_token_t token)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_adapt_native Protect Native-Only API Calls
 * In HDF5 1.14.0, a way to determine support for optional calls has been added.
 * \code
 *     herr_t H5VLquery_optional(hid_t obj_id, H5VL_subclass_t subcls, int opt_type, uint64_t *flags)
 * \endcode
 *
 * The call takes an object that is VOL managed (i.e.; file, group, dataset, attribute,
 * object, committed datatype), the VOL subclass (an enum documented
 * in H5VLpublic.h), an operation ”type” (discussed below), and an out parameter for the
 * bitwise capabilities flags (also discussed below). Code that needs
 * to protect a VOL-specific API call can call the function to see if the API
 * call is supported, which will be reported via the flags. Specifically, if the
 * #H5VL_OPT_QUERY_SUPPORTED bit is set, the feature is supported. The other flags
 * are more useful for VOL connector authors than end users.
 *
 * In the case of the native VOL connector, the opt type operations are documented in
 * H5VLnative.h. The current list of native operations is given at the
 * end of this document, along with a list of native-only connector calls.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_lang Language Wrappers
 * Due to the parameter type and callback changes that were required in the
 * C library API regarding the update from #haddr_t addresses to #H5O_token_t
 * tokens and the difficulty in versioning the wrapper APIs, it was decided to
 * update all of the wrappers to use tokens instead of addresses. This will allow
 * the language wrappers to make use of the VOL, but at the expense of backward
 * compatibility.
 *
 * Information on the C API changes can be found above.
 *
 * Affected API calls, by language:
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_lang_c C++
 * <ul>
 * <li>The \b visit_operator_t callback now uses a #H5O_info2_t parameter instead of #H5O_info1_t
 * so the callback can be passed to \ref H5Ovisit3() internally. This affects the H5Object::visit()
 * method.</li>
 * <li>The H5Location::getObjinfo() methods now take #H5O_info2_t parameters.</li>
 * <li>The H5Location::getLinkInfo() methods now return #H5L_info2_t structs.</li>
 * <li> H5File::isHdf5 uses \ref H5Fis_accessible(), though it always passes #H5P_DEFAULT
 * as the fapl. It will only work with arbitrary VOL connectors if the default
 * VOL connector is changed via the environment variable.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The C++ wrappers do not allow opening HDF5 file objects by address or token.
 *
 * The public H5VL API calls found in H5VLpublic.h were NOT added to the C++ API.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_lang_fort Fortran
 * As in the C API, these API calls had their structs updated to the token version
 * so the h5o_info_t, etc. structs no longer contain native file format information
 * and the callbacks will need to match the non-deprecated, token-enabled versions.
 * <ul>
 * <li>h5lget_info_f</li>
 * <li>h5lget_info_by_idx f</li>
 * <li>h5literate_f</li>
 * <li>h5literate_by_name_f</li>
 * <li>h5oget_info_f</li>
 * <li>h5oget_info_by_idx_f</li>
 * <li>h5oget_info_by_name_f</li>
 * <li>h5oopen_by_token_f</li>
 * <li>h5ovisit_f</li>
 * <li>h5ovisit_by_name_f</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Additionally, h5fis_hdf5_f was updated to use \ref H5Fis_accessible internally,
 * though with the same caveat as the C++ implementation: the default fapl is
 * always passed in so arbitrary VOL connectors will only work if the default VOL
 * connector is changed via the environment variable.
 *
 * The public H5VL API calls found in H5VLpublic.h were also added to the
 * Fortran wrappers.
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_lang_java Java/JNI
 * <ul>
 * <li>\ref H5Fis_hdf5 Will fail when the library is built without deprecated symbols.</li>
 * <li>\ref H5Fis_accessible is available and takes a fapl, allowing it to work with
 * arbitrary VOL connectors.</li>
 * <li>The H5(O|L)get_info, H5(O|L)visit, and \ref H5Literate calls were updated as in the C library.</li>
 * <li>\ref H5Oget_native_info_by_name et al. were added and they work as in the
 * C library (e.g.: essentially native VOL connector only).</li>
 * <li>\ref H5Oopen_by_addr was replaced with \ref H5Oopen_by_token.</li>
 * <li>The public API calls in H5VLpublic.h were added to the JNI.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_cl Using VOL Connectors With The HDF5 Command-Line Tools
 * The following command-line tools are VOL-aware and can be used with arbitrary VOL connectors:
 * \li (p)h5diff
 * \li h5dump
 * \li h5ls
 * \li h5mkgrp
 * \li h5repack
 *
 * The VOL connector can be set either using the #HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR environment variable
 * (see above) or via the command line. Each of the above tools
 * takes command-line options to set the VOL connector by name or value and
 * the VOL connector string, usually in the form of
 * \code
 *  --vol-(name|value|info)
 * \endcode
 * See the individual tool's help for the options specific to that tool.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_vol_compat Compatibility
 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_compat_native List of HDF5 Native VOL API Calls
 * These API calls will probably fail when used with terminal VOL connectors
 * other than the native HDF5 file format connector. Their use should be protected
 * in code that uses arbitrary VOL connectors. Note that some connectors may, in
 * fact, implement some of this functionality as it is possible to mimic the native
 * HDF5 connector, however this will probably not be true for most non-native
 * VOL connectors.

 * \snippet{doc} tables/volAPIs.dox vol_native_table

 *
 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_compat_indep  List of HDF5 VOL-Independent API Calls
 * These HDF5 API calls do not depend on a particular VOL connector being loaded.
 * <div>
 * \snippet{doc} tables/volAPIs.dox vol_independent_table

 * \subsubsection subsubsec_vol_compat_opt List of Native VOL Optional Operation Values By Subclass
 * These values can be passed to the opt type parameter of H5VLquery optional().
