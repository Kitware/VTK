 *          \p dst_name, is inserted at dst_loc. This change is
 *          accomplished as an atomic operation.
 *
 *          \p src_loc and \p src_name identify the original link.
 *          \p src_loc is the original location identifier; \p src_name is
 *          the path to the link and is interpreted relative to \p src_loc.
 *
 *          \p dst_loc and \p dst_name identify the new link. \p dst_loc is
 *          either a file or group identifier; \p dst_name is the path to
 *          the link and is interpreted relative to \p dst_loc.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id and \p lapl_id are the link creation and link access
 *          property lists, respectively, associated with the new link,
 *          \p dst_name.
 *
 *          Through these property lists, several properties are available to
 *          govern the behavior of H5Lmove(). The property controlling creation
 *          of missing intermediate groups is set in the link creation property
 *          list with H5Pset_create_intermediate_group(); H5Lmove() ignores any
 *          other properties in the link creation property list. Properties
 *          controlling character encoding, link traversals, and external link
 *          prefixes are set in the link access property list with
 *          H5Pset_char_encoding(), H5Pset_nlinks(), and H5Pset_elink_prefix(),
 *          respectively.
 *
 * \note Note that H5Lmove() does not modify the value of the link; the new
 *       link points to the same object as the original link pointed to.
 *       Furthermore, if the object pointed to by the original link was already
 *       open with a valid object identifier, that identifier will remain valid
 *       after the call to H5Lmove().
 *
 * \attention Exercise care in moving links as it is possible to render data in
 *            a file inaccessible with H5Lmove(). If the link being moved is on

 *          name exists in the location specified by \p loc_id. The link may be
 *          of any type; only the presence of a link with that name is checked.
 *
 *          Note that H5Lexists() verifies only that the target link exists. If
 *          name includes either a relative path or an absolute path to the
 *          target link, intermediate steps along the path must be verified
 *          before the existence of the target link can be safely checked. If
 *          the path is not verified and an intermediate element of the path
 *          does not exist, H5Lexists() will fail. The example in the next
 *          paragraph illustrates one step-by-step method for verifying the
 *          existence of a link with a relative or absolute path.
 *
 *          \Bold{Example:} Use the following steps to verify the existence of
 *          the link \c datasetD in the \c group group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/,
 *          where \c group1 is a member of the group specified by \c loc_id:
 *
 *          1. First use H5Lexists() to verify that \c group1 exists.
 *          2. If \c group1 exists, use H5Lexists() again, this time with name
 *             set to \c group1/group2, to verify that \c group2 exists.
 *          3. If \c group2 exists, use H5Lexists() with name set to
 *             \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3 to verify that
 *             \c softlink_to_group3 exists.
 *          4. If \c softlink_to_group3 exists, you can now safely use
 *             H5Lexists() with \c name set to
 *             \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/datasetD to verify that the
 *             target link, \c datasetD, exists.
 *
 *          If the link to be verified is specified with an absolute path, the
 *          same approach should be used, but starting with the first link in
 *          the file’s root group. For instance, if \c datasetD were in
 *          \c /group1/group2/softlink_to_group3, the first call to H5Lexists()
 *          would have name set to \c /group1.
 *
 *          Note that this is an outline and does not include all necessary
 *          details. Depending on circumstances, for example, you may need to
 *          verify that an intermediate link points to a group and that a soft
 *          link points to an existing target.
 *
 * \note The behavior of H5Lexists() was changed in the 1.10 release in the
 *       case where the root group, \c "/", is the name of the link. This
 *       change is described below:
 *       <ol>
 *       <li>Let \c file denote a valid HDF5 file identifier, and let \c lapl
 *          denote a valid link access property list identifier. A call to
 *          H5Lexists() with arguments \c file, \c "/", and \c lapl
 *          returns a positive value; in other words,
 *          \Code{H5Lexists(file, "/", lapl)} returns a positive value.
 *          In HDF5 version 1.8.16, this function returns 0.</li>
 *       <li>Let \c root denote a valid HDF5 group identifier that refers to the
 *          root group of an HDF5 file, and let \c lapl denote a valid link
 *          access property list identifier. A call to H5Lexists() with
 *          arguments c root, \c "/", and \c lapl returns a positive value;
 *          in other words, \Code{H5Lexists(root, "/", lapl)} returns a postive
 *          value. In HDF5 version 1.8.16, this function returns 0.</li>
 *       </ol>
 *       Note that the function accepts link names and path names. This is
 *       potentially misleading to callers, and we plan to separate the
 *       functionality for link names and path names in a future release.
 *
 * \attention H5Lexists() checks the existence of only the final element in a
 *            relative or absolute path; it does not check any other path
 *            elements. The function will therefore fail when both of the
 *            following conditions exist:
 *            - \c name is not local to the group specified by \c loc_id or,
 *              if \c loc_id is something other than a group identifier, \c name
 *              is not local to the root group.
 *            - Any element of the relative path or absolute path in name,
 *              except the target link, does not exist.
 *
 * \version 1.10.0 Function behavior changed in this release. (See the note.)

 *
 *          The possible return values from the callback function, and the

 *          class, if for no other purpose than as a variable name. Assume,
 *          for example, that a complex link type is registered with the link
 *          class identifier 73 and that the code includes the following
 *          assignment:
 *          \code
 *          H5L_TYPE_COMPLEX_A = 73
 *          \endcode
 *          The application can refer to the link class with a term,
 *          \c  H5L_TYPE_COMPLEX_A, that conveys meaning to a human reviewing
 *          the code, while HDF5 recognizes it by the more cryptic numeric
 *          identifier, 73.
 *
 * \attention Important details and considerations include the following:
 *            \li If you plan to distribute files or software with a
 *                user-defined link class, please contact the Help Desk at
 *                The HDF Group to help prevent collisions between \c class_id
 *                values. See below.
 *            \li As distributed with HDF5, the external link class is
 *                implemented as an example of a user-defined link class with
 *                #H5L_TYPE_EXTERNAL equal to #H5L_TYPE_UD_MIN. \c class_id in
 *                the H5L_class_t \c struct must not equal #H5L_TYPE_UD_MIN
 *                unless you intend to overwrite or modify the behavior of
 *                external links.
 *            \li H5Lregister() can be used only with link class identifiers
 *                in the user-definable range (see table above).
 *            \li The hard and soft links defined by the HDF5 library,
 *                #H5L_TYPE_HARD and #H5L_TYPE_SOFT, reside in the reserved
 *                range below #H5L_TYPE_UD_MIN and cannot be redefined or
 *                modified.
 *            \li H5Lis_registered() can be used to determine whether a desired
 *                link class identifier is available. \Emph{Note that this
 *                function will tell you only whether the link class identifier
 *                has been registered with the installed copy of HDF5; it
 *                cannot tell you whether the link class has been registered
 *                with The HDF Group.}
 *            \li #H5L_TYPE_MAX is the maximum allowed value for a link type
 *                identifier.
 *            \li #H5L_TYPE_UD_MIN equals #H5L_TYPE_EXTERNAL.
 *            \li #H5L_TYPE_UD_MAX equals #H5L_TYPE_MAX.
 *            \li #H5L_TYPE_ERROR indicates that an error has occurred.
 *
 * \note \Bold{Registration with The HDF Group:}\n
 *       There are sometimes reasons to take a broader approach to registering
 *       a user-defined link class than just invoking H5Lregister(). For
 *       example:
 *       \li A user-defined link class is intended for use across an
 *           organization, among collaborators, or across a community of users.
 *       \li An application or library overlying HDF5 invokes a user-defined
 *           link class that must be shipped with the software.
 *       \li Files are distributed that make use of a user-defined link class.
 *       \li Or simply, a specific user-defined link class is thought to be
 *           widely useful.
 *
 *       In such cases, you are encouraged to register that link class with
 *       The HDF Group's Helpdesk. The HDF Group maintains a registry of known
 *       user-defined link classes and tracks the selected link class
 *       identifiers. This registry is intended to reduce the risk of
 *       collisions between \c class_id values and to help coordinate the use
 *       of specialized link classes.

 * \details H5Lcreate_external() creates a new external link. An external link
 *          is a soft link to an object in a different HDF5 file from the
 *          location of the link, i.e., to an external object.
 *
 *          \p file_name identifies the target file containing the target
 *          object; \p obj_name specifies the path of the target object within
 *          that file. \p obj_name must be an absolute pathname in
 *          \p file_name, i.e., it must start at the target file’s root group,
 *          but it is not interpreted until an application attempts to traverse
 *          it.
 *
 *          \p link_loc_id and \p link_name specify the location and name,
 *          respectively, of the new link. \p link_name is interpreted relative
 *          to \p link_loc_id.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id is the link creation property list used in creating the
 *          new link.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is the link access property list used in traversing the
 *          new link. Note that an external file opened by the traversal of an
 *          external link is always opened with the weak file close degree
 *          property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK (see H5Pset_fclose_degree());
 *          any file close degree property setting in \p lapl_id is ignored.
 *
 *          An external link behaves similarly to a soft link, and like a soft
 *          link in an HDF5 file, it may dangle: the target file and object
 *          need not exist at the time that the external link is created.
 *
 *          When the external link \p link_name is accessed, the library will
 *          search for the target file \p file_name as described below:
 *
 *          - If \p file_name is a relative pathname, the following steps are
 *            performed:
 *            - The library will get the prefix(es) set in the environment
 *              variable \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX and will try to prepend each prefix
 *              to \p file_name to form a new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or if \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX
 *              is not set, the library will get the prefix set via
 *              H5Pset_elink_prefix() and prepend it to \p file_name to form a
 *              new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or no prefix is being
 *              set by H5Pset_elink_prefix(), then the path of the file
 *              associated with \p link_loc_id is obtained. This path can be
 *              the absolute path or the current working directory plus the
 *              relative path of that file when it is created/opened. The
 *              library will prepend this path to \p file_name to form a new
 *              \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist, then the library will
 *              look for \p file_name and will return failure/success
 *              accordingly.
 *          - If \p file_name is an absolute pathname, the library will first
 *            try to find \p file_name. If \p file_name does not exist,
 *            \p file_name is stripped of directory paths to form a new
 *            \p file_name. The search for the new \p file_name then follows
 *            the same steps as described above for a relative pathname. See
 *            examples below illustrating how target_file_name is stripped to
 *            form a new \p file_name.
 *
 *          Note that \p file_name is considered to be an absolute pathname
 *          when the following condition is true:
 *
 *          - For Unix, the first character of \p file_name is a slash (\c /).
 *            For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *            If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *            stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *          - For Windows, there are 6 cases:
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with absolute pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute pathname without specifying drive
 *               name. For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *               If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with relative pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c tmp\A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format with
 *               server name, share name, and pathname. For example, consider
 *               a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file does not
 *               exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with server name, share name, and pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with an absolute drive and an absolute pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *
 *          The library opens target file \p file_name with the file access
 *          property list that is set via H5Pset_elink_fapl() when the external
 *          link link_name is accessed. If no such property list is set, the
 *          library uses the file access property list associated with the file
 *          of \p link_loc_id to open the target file.
 *
 *          If an application requires additional control over file access
 *          flags or the file access property list, see H5Pset_elink_cb(); this
 *          function enables the use of an external link callback function as
 *          described in H5L_elink_traverse_t().
 *
 * \attention A file close degree property setting (H5Pset_fclose_degree()) in
 *            the external link file access property list or in the external
 *            link callback function will be ignored. A file opened by means of
 *            traversing an external link is always opened with the weak file
 *            close degree property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK .

 *          links are created. But higher-numbered entries are not adjusted
 *          when a lower-numbered link is deleted; the deleted link’s creation
 *          order position is simply left vacant. In such situations, the value

 *          number of links remaining in the group.
 *
 *          \c cset specifies the character set in which the link name is

 *          indicates that the links are accessed in lexicographic order by

 * \details H5Literate1() iterates through the links in a file or
 *          group, \p group_id, in the order of the specified
 *          index, \p idx_type, using a user-defined callback routine
 *          \p op. H5Literate1() does not recursively follow links into
 *          subgroups of the specified group.
 *
 *          Three parameters are used to manage progress of the iteration:
 *          \p idx_type, \p order, and \p idx_p.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links have
 *          not been indexed by the index type, they will first be sorted by
 *          that index then the iteration will begin; if the links have been
 *          so indexed, the sorting step will be unnecessary, so the iteration
 *          may begin more quickly.
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index \p idx_type.
 *
 *          \p idx_p tracks the iteration and allows an iteration to be
 *          resumed if it was stopped before all members were processed. It is
 *          passed in by the application with a starting point and returned by
 *          the library with the point at which the iteration stopped.
 *
 *          \p op_data is a user-defined pointer to the data required to
 *          process links in the course of the iteration. This pointer is
 *          passed back to each step of the iteration in the \p op callback
 *          function's \p op_data parameter. \p op is invoked for each link
 *          encounter.
 *
 *          \p op_data is passed to and from each iteration and can be used to
 *          supply or aggregate information across iterations.
 *

 *
 * \warning The behavior of H5Literate1() is undefined if the link
 *          membership of \p group_id changes during the iteration.

 *
 *          The possible return values from the callback function, and the

 *              all group members have been processed.
 *          \li  A positive value causes the visit iterator to immediately

 *
 *          \p lapl_id is a link access property list. In the general case,
 *          when default link access properties are acceptable, this can be
