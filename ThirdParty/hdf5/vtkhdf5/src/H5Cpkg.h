/****************************************************************************
 *
 * structure H5C_t
 *
 * Catchall structure for all variables specific to an instance of the cache.
 *
 * While the individual fields of the structure are discussed below, the
 * following overview may be helpful.
 *
 * Entries in the cache are stored in an instance of H5TB_TREE, indexed on
 * the entry's disk address.  While the H5TB_TREE is less efficient than
 * hash table, it keeps the entries in address sorted order.  As flushes
 * in parallel mode are more efficient if they are issued in increasing
 * address order, this is a significant benefit.  Also the H5TB_TREE code
 * was readily available, which reduced development time.
 *
 * While the cache was designed with multiple replacement policies in mind,
 * at present only a modified form of LRU is supported.
 *
 *                                              JRM - 4/26/04
 *
 * Profiling has indicated that searches in the instance of H5TB_TREE are
 * too expensive.  To deal with this issue, I have augmented the cache
 * with a hash table in which all entries will be stored.  Given the
 * advantages of flushing entries in increasing address order, the TBBT
 * is retained, but only dirty entries are stored in it.  At least for
 * now, we will leave entries in the TBBT after they are flushed.
 *
 * Note that index_size and index_len now refer to the total size of
 * and number of entries in the hash table.
 *
 *						JRM - 7/19/04
 *
 * The TBBT has since been replaced with a skip list.  This change
 * greatly predates this note.
 *
 *						JRM - 9/26/05
 *
 * magic:	Unsigned 32 bit integer always set to H5C__H5C_T_MAGIC. 
 * 		This field is used to validate pointers to instances of
 * 		H5C_t.
 *
 * flush_in_progress: Boolean flag indicating whether a flush is in
 * 		progress.
 *
 * trace_file_ptr:  File pointer pointing to the trace file, which is used
 *              to record cache operations for use in simulations and design
 *              studies.  This field will usually be NULL, indicating that
 *              no trace file should be recorded.
 *
 *              Since much of the code supporting the parallel metadata
 *              cache is in H5AC, we don't write the trace file from
 *              H5C.  Instead, H5AC reads the trace_file_ptr as needed.
 *
 *              When we get to using H5C in other places, we may add
 *              code to write trace file data at the H5C level as well.
 *
 * aux_ptr:	Pointer to void used to allow wrapper code to associate
 *		its data with an instance of H5C_t.  The H5C cache code
 *		sets this field to NULL, and otherwise leaves it alone.
 *
 * max_type_id:	Integer field containing the maximum type id number assigned
 *		to a type of entry in the cache.  All type ids from 0 to
 *		max_type_id inclusive must be defined.  The names of the
 *		types are stored in the type_name_table discussed below, and
 *		indexed by the ids.
 *
 * type_name_table_ptr: Pointer to an array of pointer to char of length
 *              max_type_id + 1.  The strings pointed to by the entries
 *              in the array are the names of the entry types associated
 *              with the indexing type IDs.
 *
 * max_cache_size:  Nominal maximum number of bytes that may be stored in the
 *              cache.  This value should be viewed as a soft limit, as the
 *              cache can exceed this value under the following circumstances:
 *
 *              a) All entries in the cache are protected, and the cache is
 *                 asked to insert a new entry.  In this case the new entry
 *                 will be created.  If this causes the cache to exceed
 *                 max_cache_size, it will do so.  The cache will attempt
 *                 to reduce its size as entries are unprotected.
 *
 *              b) When running in parallel mode, the cache may not be
 *		   permitted to flush a dirty entry in response to a read.
 *		   If there are no clean entries available to evict, the
 *		   cache will exceed its maximum size.  Again the cache
 *                 will attempt to reduce its size to the max_cache_size
 *                 limit on the next cache write.
 *
 *		c) When an entry increases in size, the cache may exceed
 *		   the max_cache_size limit until the next time the cache
 *		   attempts to load or insert an entry.
 *
 * min_clean_size: Nominal minimum number of clean bytes in the cache.
 *              The cache attempts to maintain this number of bytes of
 *              clean data so as to avoid case b) above.  Again, this is
 *              a soft limit.
 *
 *
 * In addition to the call back functions required for each entry, the
 * cache requires the following call back functions for this instance of
 * the cache as a whole:
 *
 * check_write_permitted:  In certain applications, the cache may not
 *		be allowed to write to disk at certain time.  If specified,
 *		the check_write_permitted function is used to determine if
 *		a write is permissible at any given point in time.
 *
 *		If no such function is specified (i.e. this field is NULL),
 *		the cache uses the following write_permitted field to
 *		determine whether writes are permitted.
 *
 * write_permitted: If check_write_permitted is NULL, this boolean flag
 *		indicates whether writes are permitted.
 *
 * log_flush:	If provided, this function is called whenever a dirty
 *		entry is flushed to disk.
 *
 *
 * In cases where memory is plentiful, and performance is an issue, it
 * is useful to disable all cache evictions, and thereby postpone metadata
 * writes.  The following field is used to implement this.
 *
 * evictions_enabled:  Boolean flag that is initialized to TRUE.  When
 * 		this flag is set to FALSE, the metadata cache will not
 * 		attempt to evict entries to make space for newly protected
 * 		entries, and instead the will grow without limit.
 * 		
 * 		Needless to say, this feature must be used with care.
 *
 *
 * The cache requires an index to facilitate searching for entries.  The
 * following fields support that index.
 *
 * index_len:   Number of entries currently in the hash table used to index
 *		the cache.
 *
 * index_size:  Number of bytes of cache entries currently stored in the
 *              hash table used to index the cache.
 *
 *              This value should not be mistaken for footprint of the
 *              cache in memory.  The average cache entry is small, and
 *              the cache has a considerable overhead.  Multiplying the
 *              index_size by two should yield a conservative estimate
 *              of the cache's memory footprint.
 *
 * clean_index_size: Number of bytes of clean entries currently stored in
 * 		the hash table.  Note that the index_size field (above)
 *		is also the sum of the sizes of all entries in the cache.
 *		Thus we should have the invarient that clean_index_size +
 *		dirty_index_size == index_size.
 *
 *		WARNING:
 *
 *		1) The clean_index_size field is not maintained by the
 *		   index macros, as the hash table doesn't care whether
 *		   the entry is clean or dirty.  Instead the field is
 *		   maintained in the H5C__UPDATE_RP macros.
 *
 *		2) The value of the clean_index_size must not be mistaken
 *		   for the current clean size of the cache.  Rather, the
 *		   clean size of the cache is the current value of
 *		   clean_index_size plus the amount of empty space (if any)
 *                 in the cache.
 *
 * dirty_index_size: Number of bytes of dirty entries currently stored in
 * 		the hash table.  Note that the index_size field (above)
 *		is also the sum of the sizes of all entries in the cache.
 *		Thus we should have the invarient that clean_index_size +
 *		dirty_index_size == index_size.
 *
 *		WARNING:
 *
 *		1) The dirty_index_size field is not maintained by the
 *		   index macros, as the hash table doesn't care whether
 *		   the entry is clean or dirty.  Instead the field is
 *		   maintained in the H5C__UPDATE_RP macros.
 *
 * index:	Array of pointer to H5C_cache_entry_t of size
 *		H5C__HASH_TABLE_LEN.  At present, this value is a power
 *		of two, not the usual prime number.
 *
 *		I hope that the variable size of cache elements, the large
 *		hash table size, and the way in which HDF5 allocates space
 *		will combine to avoid problems with periodicity.  If so, we
 *		can use a trivial hash function (a bit-and and a 3 bit left
 *		shift) with some small savings.
 *
 *		If not, it will become evident in the statistics. Changing
 *		to the usual prime number length hash table will require
 *		changing the H5C__HASH_FCN macro and the deletion of the
 *		H5C__HASH_MASK #define.  No other changes should be required.
 *
 *
 * When we flush the cache, we need to write entries out in increasing
 * address order.  An instance of a skip list is used to store dirty entries in
 * sorted order.  Whether it is cheaper to sort the dirty entries as needed,
 * or to maintain the list is an open question.  At a guess, it depends
 * on how frequently the cache is flushed.  We will see how it goes.
 *
 * For now at least, I will not remove dirty entries from the list as they
 * are flushed. (this has been changed -- dirty entries are now removed from
 * the skip list as they are flushed.  JRM - 10/25/05)
 *
 * slist_len:   Number of entries currently in the skip list
 *              used to maintain a sorted list of dirty entries in the
 *              cache.
 *
 * slist_size:  Number of bytes of cache entries currently stored in the
 *              skip list used to maintain a sorted list of
 *              dirty entries in the cache.
 *
 * slist_ptr:   pointer to the instance of H5SL_t used maintain a sorted
 *              list of dirty entries in the cache.  This sorted list has
 *              two uses:
 *
 *              a) It allows us to flush dirty entries in increasing address
 *                 order, which results in significant savings.
 *
 *              b) It facilitates checking for adjacent dirty entries when
 *                 attempting to evict entries from the cache.  While we
 *                 don't use this at present, I hope that this will allow
 *                 some optimizations when I get to it.
 *
 * With the addition of the fractal heap, the cache must now deal with
 * the case in which entries may be dirtied, moved, or have their sizes
 * changed during a flush.  To allow sanity checks in this situation, the
 * following two fields have been added.  They are only compiled in when
 * H5C_DO_SANITY_CHECKS is TRUE.
 *
 * slist_len_increase: Number of entries that have been added to the
 * 		slist since the last time this field was set to zero.
 *
 * slist_size_increase: Total size of all entries that have been added
 * 		to the slist since the last time this field was set to
 * 		zero.
 *
 *
 * When a cache entry is protected, it must be removed from the LRU
 * list(s) as it cannot be either flushed or evicted until it is unprotected.
 * The following fields are used to implement the protected list (pl).
 *
 * pl_len:      Number of entries currently residing on the protected list.
 *
 * pl_size:     Number of bytes of cache entries currently residing on the
 *              protected list.
 *
 * pl_head_ptr: Pointer to the head of the doubly linked list of protected
 *              entries.  Note that cache entries on this list are linked
 *              by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * pl_tail_ptr: Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked list of protected
 *              entries.  Note that cache entries on this list are linked
 *              by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 *
 * For very frequently used entries, the protect/unprotect overhead can
 * become burdensome.  To avoid this overhead, I have modified the cache
 * to allow entries to be "pinned".  A pinned entry is similar to a
 * protected entry, in the sense that it cannot be evicted, and that
 * the entry can be modified at any time.
 *
 * Pinning an entry has the following implications:
 *
 *	1) A pinned entry cannot be evicted.  Thus unprotected
 *         pinned entries reside in the pinned entry list, instead
 *         of the LRU list(s) (or other lists maintained by the current
 *         replacement policy code).
 *
 *      2) A pinned entry can be accessed or modified at any time.
 *         Therefore, the cache must check with the entry owner
 *         before flushing it.  If permission is denied, the
 *         cache just skips the entry in the flush.
 *
 *      3) A pinned entry can be marked as dirty (and possibly
 *         change size) while it is unprotected.
 *
 *      4) The flush-destroy code must allow pinned entries to
 *         be unpinned (and possibly unprotected) during the
 *         flush.
 *
 * Since pinned entries cannot be evicted, they must be kept on a pinned
 * entry list, instead of being entrusted to the replacement policy code.
 *
 * Maintaining the pinned entry list requires the following fields:
 *
 * pel_len:	Number of entries currently residing on the pinned
 * 		entry list.
 *
 * pel_size:	Number of bytes of cache entries currently residing on
 * 		the pinned entry list.
 *
 * pel_head_ptr: Pointer to the head of the doubly linked list of pinned
 * 		but not protected entries.  Note that cache entries on
 * 		this list are linked by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * pel_tail_ptr: Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked list of pinned
 * 		but not protected entries.  Note that cache entries on
 * 		this list are linked by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 *
 * The cache must have a replacement policy, and the fields supporting this
 * policy must be accessible from this structure.
 *
 * While there has been interest in several replacement policies for
 * this cache, the initial development schedule is tight.  Thus I have
 * elected to support only a modified LRU policy for the first cut.
 *
 * To further simplify matters, I have simply included the fields needed
 * by the modified LRU in this structure.  When and if we add support for
 * other policies, it will probably be easiest to just add the necessary
 * fields to this structure as well -- we only create one instance of this
 * structure per file, so the overhead is not excessive.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting the modified LRU policy:
 *
 * See most any OS text for a discussion of the LRU replacement policy.
 *
 * When operating in parallel mode, we must ensure that a read does not
 * cause a write.  If it does, the process will hang, as the write will
 * be collective and the other processes will not know to participate.
 *
 * To deal with this issue, I have modified the usual LRU policy by adding
 * clean and dirty LRU lists to the usual LRU list.
 *
 * The clean LRU list is simply the regular LRU list with all dirty cache
 * entries removed.
 *
 * Similarly, the dirty LRU list is the regular LRU list with all the clean
 * cache entries removed.
 *
 * When reading in parallel mode, we evict from the clean LRU list only.
 * This implies that we must try to ensure that the clean LRU list is
 * reasonably well stocked at all times.
 *
 * We attempt to do this by trying to flush enough entries on each write
 * to keep the cLRU_list_size >= min_clean_size.
 *
 * Even if we start with a completely clean cache, a sequence of protects
 * without unprotects can empty the clean LRU list.  In this case, the
 * cache must grow temporarily.  At the next write, we will attempt to
 * evict enough entries to reduce index_size to less than max_cache_size.
 * While this will usually be possible, all bets are off if enough entries
 * are protected.
 *
 * Discussions of the individual fields used by the modified LRU replacement
 * policy follow:
 *
 * LRU_list_len:  Number of cache entries currently on the LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_list_len + pl_len must always equal
 *              index_len.
 *
 * LRU_list_size:  Number of bytes of cache entries currently residing on the
 *              LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_list_size + pl_size must always equal
 *              index_size.
 *
 * LRU_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked LRU list.  Cache
 *              entries on this list are linked by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * LRU_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked LRU list.  Cache
 *              entries on this list are linked by their next and prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * cLRU_list_len: Number of cache entries currently on the clean LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that cLRU_list_len + dLRU_list_len must always
 *              equal LRU_list_len.
 *
 * cLRU_list_size:  Number of bytes of cache entries currently residing on
 *              the clean LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that cLRU_list_size + dLRU_list_size must always
 *              equal LRU_list_size.
 *
 * cLRU_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked clean LRU list.
 *              Cache entries on this list are linked by their aux_next and
 *              aux_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * cLRU_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked clean LRU list.
 *              Cache entries on this list are linked by their aux_next and
 *              aux_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * dLRU_list_len: Number of cache entries currently on the dirty LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that cLRU_list_len + dLRU_list_len must always
 *              equal LRU_list_len.
 *
 * dLRU_list_size:  Number of cache entries currently on the dirty LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that cLRU_list_len + dLRU_list_len must always
 *              equal LRU_list_len.
 *
 * dLRU_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked dirty LRU list.
 *              Cache entries on this list are linked by their aux_next and
 *              aux_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * dLRU_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked dirty LRU list.
 *              Cache entries on this list are linked by their aux_next and
 *              aux_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 *
 * Automatic cache size adjustment:
 *
 * While the default cache size is adequate for most cases, we can run into
 * cases where the default is too small.  Ideally, we will let the user
 * adjust the cache size as required.  However, this is not possible in all
 * cases.  Thus I have added automatic cache size adjustment code.
 *
 * The configuration for the automatic cache size adjustment is stored in
 * the structure described below:
 *
 * size_increase_possible:  Depending on the configuration data given
 *		in the resize_ctl field, it may or may not be possible
 *		to increase the size of the cache.  Rather than test for
 *		all the ways this can happen, we simply set this flag when
 *		we receive a new configuration.
 *
 * flash_size_increase_possible: Depending on the configuration data given
 *              in the resize_ctl field, it may or may not be possible
 *              for a flash size increase to occur.  We set this flag
 *              whenever we receive a new configuration so as to avoid
 *              repeated calculations.
 *
 * flash_size_increase_threshold: If a flash cache size increase is possible,
 *              this field is used to store the minimum size of a new entry
 *              or size increase needed to trigger a flash cache size
 *              increase.  Note that this field must be updated whenever
 *              the size of the cache is changed.
 *
 * size_decrease_possible:  Depending on the configuration data given
 *              in the resize_ctl field, it may or may not be possible
 *              to decrease the size of the cache.  Rather than test for
 *              all the ways this can happen, we simply set this flag when
 *              we receive a new configuration.
 *
 * cache_full:	Boolean flag used to keep track of whether the cache is
 *		full, so we can refrain from increasing the size of a
 *		cache which hasn't used up the space alotted to it.
 *
 *		The field is initialized to FALSE, and then set to TRUE
 *		whenever we attempt to make space in the cache.
 *
 * resize_enabled:  This is another convenience flag which is set whenever
 *		a new set of values for resize_ctl are provided.  Very
 *		simply,
 *
 *		    resize_enabled = size_increase_possible ||
 *                                   size_decrease_possible;
 *
 * size_decreased:  Boolean flag set to TRUE whenever the maximun cache
 *		size is decreased.  The flag triggers a call to
 *		H5C_make_space_in_cache() on the next call to H5C_protect().
 *
 * resize_ctl:	Instance of H5C_auto_size_ctl_t containing configuration
 * 		data for automatic cache resizing.
 *
 * epoch_markers_active:  Integer field containing the number of epoch
 *		markers currently in use in the LRU list.  This value
 *		must be in the range [0, H5C__MAX_EPOCH_MARKERS - 1].
 *
 * epoch_marker_active:  Array of boolean of length H5C__MAX_EPOCH_MARKERS.
 *		This array is used to track which epoch markers are currently
 *		in use.
 *
 * epoch_marker_ringbuf:  Array of int of length H5C__MAX_EPOCH_MARKERS + 1.
 *
 *		To manage the epoch marker cache entries, it is necessary
 *		to track their order in the LRU list.  This is done with
 *		epoch_marker_ringbuf.  When markers are inserted at the
 *		head of the LRU list, the index of the marker in the
 *		epoch_markers array is inserted at the tail of the ring
 *		buffer.  When it becomes the epoch_marker_active'th marker
 *		in the LRU list, it will have worked its way to the head
 *		of the ring buffer as well.  This allows us to remove it
 *		without scanning the LRU list if such is required.
 *
 * epoch_marker_ringbuf_first: Integer field containing the index of the
 *		first entry in the ring buffer.
 *
 * epoch_marker_ringbuf_last: Integer field containing the index of the
 *		last entry in the ring buffer.
 *
 * epoch_marker_ringbuf_size: Integer field containing the number of entries
 *		in the ring buffer.
 *
 * epoch_markers:  Array of instances of H5C_cache_entry_t of length
 *		H5C__MAX_EPOCH_MARKERS.  The entries are used as markers
 *		in the LRU list to identify cache entries that haven't
 *		been accessed for some (small) specified number of
 *		epochs.  These entries (if any) can then be evicted and
 *		the cache size reduced -- ideally without evicting any
 *		of the current working set.  Needless to say, the epoch
 *		length and the number of epochs before an unused entry
 *		must be chosen so that all, or almost all, the working
 *		set will be accessed before the limit.
 *
 *		Epoch markers only appear in the LRU list, never in
 *		the index or slist.  While they are of type
 *		H5C__EPOCH_MARKER_TYPE, and have associated class
 *		functions, these functions should never be called.
 *
 *		The addr fields of these instances of H5C_cache_entry_t
 *		are set to the index of the instance in the epoch_markers
 *		array, the size is set to 0, and the type field points
 *		to the constant structure epoch_marker_class defined
 *		in H5C.c.  The next and prev fields are used as usual
 *		to link the entry into the LRU list.
 *
 *		All other fields are unused.
 *
 *
 * Cache hit rate collection fields:
 *
 * We supply the current cache hit rate on request, so we must keep a
 * simple cache hit rate computation regardless of whether statistics
 * collection is enabled.  The following fields support this capability.
 *
 * cache_hits: Number of cache hits since the last time the cache hit
 *	rate statistics were reset.  Note that when automatic cache
 *	re-sizing is enabled, this field will be reset every automatic
 *	resize epoch.
 *
 * cache_accesses: Number of times the cache has been accessed while
 *	since the last since the last time the cache hit rate statistics
 *	were reset.  Note that when automatic cache re-sizing is enabled,
 *	this field will be reset every automatic resize epoch.

 * Fields supporting testing:
 *
 * For test purposes, it is useful to turn off some asserts and sanity
 * checks.  The following flags support this.
 *
 * skip_file_checks:  Boolean flag used to skip sanity checks on file
 *		parameters passed to the cache.  In the test bed, there
 *		is no reason to have a file open, as the cache proper
 *		just passes these parameters through without using them.
 *
 *		When this flag is set, all sanity checks on the file
 *		parameters are skipped.  The field defaults to FALSE.
 *
 * skip_dxpl_id_checks:  Boolean flag used to skip sanity checks on the
 *		dxpl_id parameters passed to the cache.  These are not
 *		used directly by the cache, so skipping the checks
 *		simplifies the test bed.
 *
 *		When this flag is set, all sanity checks on the dxpl_id
 *		parameters are skipped.  The field defaults to FALSE.
 *
 * prefix	Array of char used to prefix debugging output.  The
 *		field is intended to allow marking of output of with
 *		the processes mpi rank.

/****************************************************************************
 *
 * We maintain doubly linked lists of instances of H5C_cache_entry_t for a
 * variety of reasons -- protected list, LRU list, and the clean and dirty
 * LRU lists at present.  The following macros support linking and unlinking
 * of instances of H5C_cache_entry_t by both their regular and auxilary next
 * and previous pointers.
 *
 * The size and length fields are also maintained.
 *
 * Note that the relevant pair of prev and next pointers are presumed to be
 * NULL on entry in the insertion macros.
 *
 * Finally, observe that the sanity checking macros evaluate to the empty
 * string when H5C_DO_SANITY_CHECKS is FALSE.  They also contain calls
 * to the HGOTO_ERROR macro, which may not be appropriate in all cases.
 * If so, we will need versions of the insertion and deletion macros which
 * do not reference the sanity checking macros.
 *							JRM - 5/5/04
 *
 * Changes:
 *
 *  - Removed the line:
 *
 *        ( ( (Size) == (entry_ptr)->size ) && ( (len) != 1 ) ) ||
 *
 *    from the H5C__DLL_PRE_REMOVE_SC macro.  With the addition of the
 *    epoch markers used in the age out based cache size reduction algorithm,
 *    this invarient need not hold, as the epoch markers are of size 0.
 *
 *    One could argue that I should have given the epoch markers a positive
 *    size, but this would break the index_size = LRU_list_size + pl_size
 *    + pel_size invarient.
 *
 *    Alternatively, I could pass the current decr_mode in to the macro,
 *    and just skip the check whenever epoch markers may be in use.
 *
 *    However, any size errors should be caught when the cache is flushed
 *    and destroyed.  Until we are tracking such an error, this should be
 *    good enough.
 *                                                     JRM - 12/9/04
 *
 *
 *  - In the H5C__DLL_PRE_INSERT_SC macro, replaced the lines:
 *
 *    ( ( (len) == 1 ) &&
 *      ( ( (head_ptr) != (tail_ptr) ) || ( (Size) <= 0 ) ||
 *        ( (head_ptr) == NULL ) || ( (head_ptr)->size != (Size) )
 *      )
 *    ) ||
 *
 *    with:
 *
 *    ( ( (len) == 1 ) &&
 *      ( ( (head_ptr) != (tail_ptr) ) ||
 *        ( (head_ptr) == NULL ) || ( (head_ptr)->size != (Size) )
 *      )
 *    ) ||
 *
 *    Epoch markers have size 0, so we can now have a non-empty list with
 *    zero size.  Hence the "( (Size) <= 0 )" clause cause false failures
 *    in the sanity check.  Since "Size" is typically a size_t, it can't
 *    take on negative values, and thus the revised clause "( (Size) < 0 )"
 *    caused compiler warnings.
 *                                                     JRM - 12/22/04
 *
 *  - In the H5C__DLL_SC macro, replaced the lines:
 *
 *    ( ( (len) == 1 ) &&
 *      ( ( (head_ptr) != (tail_ptr) ) || ( (cache_ptr)->size <= 0 ) ||
 *        ( (head_ptr) == NULL ) || ( (head_ptr)->size != (Size) )
 *      )
 *    ) ||
 *
 *    with
 *
 *    ( ( (len) == 1 ) &&
 *      ( ( (head_ptr) != (tail_ptr) ) ||
 *        ( (head_ptr) == NULL ) || ( (head_ptr)->size != (Size) )
 *      )
 *    ) ||

 *
 *  - Added the H5C__DLL_UPDATE_FOR_SIZE_CHANGE macro and the associated
 *    sanity checking macros.  These macro are used to update the size of
 *    a DLL when one of its entries changes size.

/***********************************************************************
 *
 * Stats collection macros
 *
 * The following macros must handle stats collection when this collection
 * is enabled, and evaluate to the empty string when it is not.
 *
 * The sole exception to this rule is
 * H5C__UPDATE_CACHE_HIT_RATE_STATS(), which is always active as
 * the cache hit rate stats are always collected and available.
 *
 * Changes:
 *
 * 	JRM -- 3/21/06
 * 	Added / updated macros for pinned entry related stats.
 *
 * 	JRM -- 8/9/06
 * 	More pinned entry stats related updates.
 *
 * 	JRM -- 3/31/07
 * 	Updated H5C__UPDATE_STATS_FOR_PROTECT() to keep stats on
 * 	read and write protects.
 *
 *      MAM -- 1/15/09
 *      Created H5C__UPDATE_MAX_INDEX_SIZE_STATS to contain
 *      common code within macros that update the maximum
 *      index, clean_index, and dirty_index statistics fields.

/**************************************************************************
 *
 * Skip list insertion and deletion macros:
 *
 * These used to be functions, but I converted them to macros to avoid some
 * function call overhead.
 *
 **************************************************************************/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Macro:	H5C__INSERT_ENTRY_IN_SLIST
 *
 * Purpose:     Insert the specified instance of H5C_cache_entry_t into
 *		the skip list in the specified instance of H5C_t.  Update
 *		the associated length and size fields.
 *
 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 5/10/04
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM -- 7/21/04
 *		Updated function to set the in_tree flag when inserting
 *		an entry into the tree.  Also modified the function to
 *		update the tree size and len fields instead of the similar
 *		index fields.
 *
 *		All of this is part of the modifications to support the
 *		hash table.
 *
 *		JRM -- 7/27/04
 *		Converted the function H5C_insert_entry_in_tree() into
 *		the macro H5C__INSERT_ENTRY_IN_TREE in the hopes of
 *		wringing a little more speed out of the cache.
 *
 *		Note that we don't bother to check if the entry is already
 *		in the tree -- if it is, H5SL_insert() will fail.
 *
 *		QAK -- 11/27/04
 *		Switched over to using skip list routines.
 *
 *		JRM -- 6/27/06
 *		Added fail_val parameter.
 *
 *		JRM -- 8/25/06
 *		Added the H5C_DO_SANITY_CHECKS version of the macro.
 *
 *		This version maintains the slist_len_increase and
 *		slist_size_increase fields that are used in sanity
 *		checks in the flush routines.
 *
 *		All this is needed as the fractal heap needs to be
 *		able to dirty, resize and/or move entries during the
 *		flush.

 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 9/07/05
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM -- 8/27/06
 *		Added the H5C_DO_SANITY_CHECKS version of the macro.
 *
 *		This version maintains the slist_size_increase field
 *		that are used in sanity checks in the flush routines.
 *
 *		All this is needed as the fractal heap needs to be
 *		able to dirty, resize and/or move entries during the
 *		flush.

 * Replacement policy update macros:

 *
 **************************************************************************/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Macro:	H5C__FAKE_RP_FOR_MOST_RECENT_ACCESS
 *
 * Purpose:     For efficiency, we sometimes change the order of flushes --
 *		but doing so can confuse the replacement policy.  This
 *		macro exists to allow us to specify an entry as the
 *		most recently touched so we can repair any such
 *		confusion.
 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If
 *		we ever support other replacement policies, the macro
 *		should switch on the current policy and act accordingly.
 *
 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 10/13/05
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM -- 3/20/06
 *		Modified macro to ignore pinned entries.  Pinned entries
 *		do not appear in the data structures maintained by the
 *		replacement policy code, and thus this macro has nothing
 *		to do if called for such an entry.
 *
 *		JRM -- 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks using the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

 *
 * Macro:	H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_EVICTION
 *
 * Purpose:     Update the replacement policy data structures for an
 *		eviction of the specified cache entry.
 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If
 *		we ever support other replacement policies, the function
 *		should switch on the current policy and act accordingly.
 *
 * Return:      Non-negative on success/Negative on failure.
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 5/10/04
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM - 7/27/04
 *		Converted the function H5C_update_rp_for_eviction() to the
 *		macro H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_EVICTION in an effort to squeeze
 *		a bit more performance out of the cache.
 *
 *		At least for the first cut, I am leaving the comments and
 *		white space in the macro.  If they cause dificulties with
 *		the pre-processor, I'll have to remove them.
 *
 *		JRM - 7/28/04
 *		Split macro into two version, one supporting the clean and
 *		dirty LRU lists, and the other not.  Yet another attempt
 *		at optimization.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/20/06
 *		Pinned entries can't be evicted, so this entry should never
 *		be called on a pinned entry.  Added assert to verify this.
 *
 *		JRM -- 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks for the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

 * Macro:	H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_INSERTION

 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If

 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 5/17/04
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM - 7/27/04
 *		Converted the function H5C_update_rp_for_insertion() to the
 *		macro H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_INSERTION in an effort to squeeze
 *		a bit more performance out of the cache.
 *
 *		At least for the first cut, I am leaving the comments and
 *		white space in the macro.  If they cause dificulties with
 *		pre-processor, I'll have to remove them.
 *
 *		JRM - 7/28/04
 *		Split macro into two version, one supporting the clean and
 *		dirty LRU lists, and the other not.  Yet another attempt
 *		at optimization.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/10/06
 *		This macro should never be called on a pinned entry.
 *		Inserted an assert to verify this.
 *
 *		JRM - 8/9/06
 *		Not any more.  We must now allow insertion of pinned
 *		entries.  Updated macro to support this.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks using the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

 *
 * Macro:	H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_MOVE
 *
 * Purpose:     Update the replacement policy data structures for a
 *		move of the specified cache entry.
 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If
 *		we ever support other replacement policies, the function
 *		should switch on the current policy and act accordingly.
 *
 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 5/17/04
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM - 7/27/04
 *		Converted the function H5C_update_rp_for_move() to the
 *		macro H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_MOVE in an effort to squeeze
 *		a bit more performance out of the cache.
 *
 *		At least for the first cut, I am leaving the comments and
 *		white space in the macro.  If they cause dificulties with
 *		pre-processor, I'll have to remove them.
 *
 *		JRM - 7/28/04
 *		Split macro into two version, one supporting the clean and
 *		dirty LRU lists, and the other not.  Yet another attempt
 *		at optimization.
 *
 *		JRM - 6/23/05
 *		Added the was_dirty parameter.  It is possible that
 *		the entry was clean when it was moved -- if so it
 *		it is in the clean LRU regardless of the current
 *		value of the is_dirty field.
 *
 *		At present, all moved entries are forced to be
 *		dirty.  This macro is a bit more general that that,
 *		to allow it to function correctly should that policy
 *		be relaxed in the future.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/17/06
 *		Modified macro to do nothing if the entry is pinned.
 *		In this case, the entry is on the pinned entry list, not
 *		in the replacement policy data structures, so there is
 *		nothing to be done.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks using the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Macro:	H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_SIZE_CHANGE
 *
 * Purpose:     Update the replacement policy data structures for a
 *		size change of the specified cache entry.
 *
 *		To do this, determine if the entry is pinned.  If it is,
 *		update the size of the pinned entry list.
 *
 *		If it isn't pinned, the entry must handled by the
 *		replacement policy.  Update the appropriate replacement
 *		policy data structures.
 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If
 *		we ever support other replacement policies, the function
 *		should switch on the current policy and act accordingly.
 *
 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 8/23/06
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 * 		JRM -- 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks based on the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

 *
 * Macro:	H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_UNPIN
 *
 * Purpose:     Update the replacement policy data structures for an
 *		unpin of the specified cache entry.
 *
 *		To do this, unlink the specified entry from the protected
 *		entry list, and re-insert it in the data structures used
 *		by the current replacement policy.
 *
 *		At present, we only support the modified LRU policy, so
 *		this function deals with that case unconditionally.  If
 *		we ever support other replacement policies, the macro
 *		should switch on the current policy and act accordingly.
 *
 * Return:      N/A
 *
 * Programmer:  John Mainzer, 3/22/06
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM -- 3/28/07
 *		Added sanity checks based on the new is_read_only and
 *		ro_ref_count fields of struct H5C_cache_entry_t.

 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *		JRM - 7/27/04
 *		Converted the function H5C_update_rp_for_unprotect() to
 *		the macro H5C__UPDATE_RP_FOR_UNPROTECT in an effort to
 *		squeeze a bit more performance out of the cache.
 *
 *		At least for the first cut, I am leaving the comments and
 *		white space in the macro.  If they cause dificulties with
 *		pre-processor, I'll have to remove them.
 *
 *		JRM - 7/28/04
 *		Split macro into two version, one supporting the clean and
 *		dirty LRU lists, and the other not.  Yet another attempt
 *		at optimization.
 *
 *		JRM - 3/17/06
 *		Modified macro to put pinned entries on the pinned entry
 *		list instead of inserting them in the data structures
 *		maintained by the replacement policy.
