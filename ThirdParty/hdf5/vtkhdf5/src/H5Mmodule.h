/**

 * \brief Map Interface
 *
 * \details \Bold{The interface can only be used with the HDF5 VOL connectors that
 *          implement map objects.} The native HDF5 library does not support this
 *          feature.
 *
 *          While the HDF5 data model is a flexible way to store data, some
 *          applications require a more general way to index information. HDF5
 *          effectively uses key-value stores internally for a variety of
 *          purposes, but it does not expose a generic key-value store to the
 *          API. The Map APIs provide this capability to the HDF5 applications
 *          in the form of HDF5 map objects. These Map objects contain
 *          application-defined key-value stores, to which key-value pairs can
 *          be added, and from which values can be retrieved by key.
 *
 *          HDF5 VOL connectors with support for map objects:
 *          - DAOS
 *
 * \par Example:
 * \code
 * hid_t file_id, fapl_id, map_id, vls_type_id;
 * const char *names[2] = ["Alice", "Bob"];
 * uint64_t IDs[2] = [25385486, 34873275];
 * uint64_t val_out;
 *
 * <HDF5 VOL setup code ....>
 *
 * vls_type_id = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1);
 * H5Tset_size(vls_type_id, H5T_VARIABLE);
 * file_id = H5Fcreate("file.h5", H5F_ACC_TRUNC, H5P_DEFAULT, fapl_id);
 * map_id = H5Mcreate(file_id, "map", vls_type_id, H5T_NATIVE_UINT64, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * H5Mput(map_id, vls_type_id, &names[0], H5T_NATIVE_UINT64, &IDs[0], H5P_DEFAULT);
 * H5Mput(map_id, vls_type_id, &names[1], H5T_NATIVE_UINT64, &IDs[1], H5P_DEFAULT);
 * H5Mget(map_id, vls_type_id, &names[0], H5T_NATIVE_UINT64, &val_out, H5P_DEFAULT);
 * if(val_out != IDs[0])
 *   ERROR;
 * H5Mclose(map_id);
 * H5Tclose(vls_type_id);
 * H5Fclose(file_id);
 * \endcode
