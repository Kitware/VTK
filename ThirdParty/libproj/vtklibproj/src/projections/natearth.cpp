/*
The Natural Earth projection was designed by Tom Patterson, US National Park
Service, in 2007, using Flex Projector. The shape of the original projection
was defined at every 5 degrees and piece-wise cubic spline interpolation was
used to compute the complete graticule.
The code here uses polynomial functions instead of cubic splines and
is therefore much simpler to program. The polynomial approximation was
developed by Bojan Savric, in collaboration with Tom Patterson and Bernhard
Jenny, Institute of Cartography, ETH Zurich. It slightly deviates from
Patterson's original projection by adding additional curvature to meridians
where they meet the horizontal pole line. This improvement is by intention
and designed in collaboration with Tom Patterson.
