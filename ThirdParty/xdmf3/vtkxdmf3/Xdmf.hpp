/*! \mainpage XDMF API
*
* \section intro Introduction
*
* The eXtensible Data Model and Format (XDMF) is a distributed data
* hub for accessing scientific data in High Performance Computing
* (HPC) applications. XDMF defines a data model and format as well as
* facilities for accessing the data in a distributed environment.
*
* XDMF differs from other data model and format efforts in that the
* "light data" is logically (and possibly physically) separated from
* the "heavy data". Light data is considered to be both "data about
* the data" such as dimensions and name, as well as small quantities
* of computed data. Heavy data is considered to be large amounts of
* data. For example, in a three dimensional structural mechanics
* calculation, the size and dimensions of the computational grid are
* light data while the actual X, Y, and Z values for the grid are
* heavy data. Calculated values like "Pressure at a node" are heavy,
* while "Total Residual Mass" for the entire calculation is light.
* Light data is stored on disk in a machine parsable language like
* XML. Heavy data is stored in a format suitable for large amounts of
* data like HDF5.
*
* While use of the XDMF API is not necessary to produce or consume
* valid datasets, it is extremely useful for handling the wide variety
* of files that are possible and its use is highly recommended. The
* XDMF API is written in C++ and is wrapped for access from other
* languages including Python and Java.
*
* XDMF utilizes reference counting shared pointers to handle ownership
* of XDMF objects. This allows multiple objects to reference a single
* XDMF object. An object is deleted and memory is reclaimed when no
* other XDMF objects hold a reference to the object. This allows
* flexibility in constructing XDMF structures, as simple structures
* can be shared instead of copied.
*
* All XDMF objects are constructed by calling New(), which returns a
* shared pointer to a newly constructed object. All default
* constructors in the XDMF API are protected, ensuring that only
* shared pointers can be created. These pointers are freed
* automatically by the shared pointer reference counting mechanism.
*
*
* Structure:
*
* Xdmf2 is structured in a tree format with an XdmfDomain serving
* as the base. The Domain contains multiple grid collections or
* grids; each with their own geometries, topologies, attributes,
* and/or sets. With the inclusion of shared pointers in Xdmf2
* a topology could be shared across multiple grids or a grid
* could be included in multiple grid collections and/or the domain.
*
* Comparing objects is done by comparing pointer addresses,
* a deep copy will not produce an equivalent object.
*
