/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief This is the only file required to use The Lean Mean C++ Option Parser.
 *        Just \#include it and you're set.
 *
 * The Lean Mean C++ Option Parser handles the program's command line arguments
 * (argc, argv).
 * It supports the short and long option formats of getopt(), getopt_long()
 * and getopt_long_only() but has a more convenient interface.
 *
 * @par Feedback:
 * Send questions, bug reports, feature requests etc. to: <tt><b>optionparser-feedback(a)lists.sourceforge.net</b></tt>
 *
 * @par Highlights:
 * <ul style="padding-left:1em;margin-left:0">
 * <li> It is a header-only library. Just <code>\#include "optionparser.h"</code> and you're set.
 * <li> It is freestanding. There are no dependencies whatsoever, not even the
 *      C or C++ standard library.
 * <li> It has a usage message formatter that supports column alignment and
 *      line wrapping. This aids localization because it adapts to
 *      translated strings that are shorter or longer (even if they contain
 *      Asian wide characters).
 * <li> Unlike getopt() and derivatives it doesn't force you to loop through
 *     options sequentially. Instead you can access options directly like this:
 *     <ul style="margin-top:.5em">
 *     <li> Test for presence of a switch in the argument vector:
 *      @code if ( options[QUIET] ) ... @endcode
 *     <li> Evaluate --enable-foo/--disable-foo pair where the last one used wins:
 *     @code if ( options[FOO].last()->type() == DISABLE ) ... @endcode
 *     <li> Cumulative option (-v verbose, -vv more verbose, -vvv even more verbose):
 *     @code int verbosity = options[VERBOSE].count(); @endcode
 *     <li> Iterate over all --file=&lt;fname> arguments:
 *     @code for (Option* opt = options[FILE]; opt; opt = opt->next())
 *   fname = opt->arg; ... @endcode
 *     <li> If you really want to, you can still process all arguments in order:
 *     @code
 *   for (int i = 0; i < p.optionsCount(); ++i) {
 *     Option& opt = buffer[i];
 *     switch(opt.index()) {
 *       case HELP:    ...
 *       case VERBOSE: ...
 *       case FILE:    fname = opt.arg; ...
 *       case UNKNOWN: ...
 *     @endcode
 *     </ul>
 * </ul> @n
 * Despite these features the code size remains tiny.
 * It is smaller than <a href="http://uclibc.org">uClibc</a>'s GNU getopt() and just a
 * couple 100 bytes larger than uClibc's SUSv3 getopt(). @n
 * (This does not include the usage formatter, of course. But you don't have to use that.)
 *

 * Tarball with examples and test programs:
 * <a style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/optionparser/files/optionparser-1.7.tar.gz/download">optionparser-1.7.tar.gz</a> @n

 *
 * @par Changelog:
 * <b>Version 1.7:</b> Work on const-correctness. @n
 * <b>Version 1.6:</b> Fix for MSC compiler. @n
 * <b>Version 1.5:</b> Fixed 2 warnings about potentially uninitialized variables. @n
 *                     Added const version of Option::next(). @n
 * <b>Version 1.4:</b> Fixed 2 printUsage() bugs that messed up output with small COLUMNS values. @n
 * <b>Version 1.3:</b> Compatible with Microsoft Visual C++. @n
 * <b>Version 1.2:</b> Added @ref option::Option::namelen "Option::namelen" and removed the extraction
 *                     of short option characters into a special buffer. @n
 *                     Changed @ref option::Arg::Optional "Arg::Optional" to accept arguments if they are attached
 *                     rather than separate. This is what GNU getopt() does and how POSIX recommends
 *                     utilities should interpret their arguments.@n
 * <b>Version 1.1:</b> Optional mode with argument reordering as done by GNU getopt(), so that
 *                     options and non-options can be mixed. See
 *                     @ref option::Parser::parse() "Parser::parse()".

 *
 * @par Option syntax:
 * @li The Lean Mean C++ Option Parser follows POSIX <code>getopt()</code> conventions and supports
 *     GNU-style <code>getopt_long()</code> long options as well as Perl-style single-minus
 *     long options (<code>getopt_long_only()</code>).
 * @li short options have the format @c -X where @c X is any character that fits in a char.
 * @li short options can be grouped, i.e. <code>-X -Y</code> is equivalent to @c -XY.
 * @li a short option may take an argument either separate (<code>-X foo</code>) or
 *     attached (@c -Xfoo). You can make the parser accept the additional format @c -X=foo by
 *     registering @c X as a long option (in addition to being a short option) and
 *     enabling single-minus long options.
 * @li an argument-taking short option may be grouped if it is the last in the group, e.g.
 *     @c -ABCXfoo or <code> -ABCX foo </code> (@c foo is the argument to the @c -X option).
 * @li a lone minus character @c '-' is not treated as an option. It is customarily used where
 *     a file name is expected to refer to stdin or stdout.
 * @li long options have the format @c --option-name.
 * @li the option-name of a long option can be anything and include any characters.
 *     Even @c = characters will work, but don't do that.
 * @li [optional] long options may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.
 *     You can set a minimum length for abbreviations.
 * @li [optional] long options may begin with a single minus. The double minus form is always
 *     accepted, too.
 * @li a long option may take an argument either separate (<code> --option arg </code>) or
 *     attached (<code> --option=arg </code>). In the attached form the equals sign is mandatory.
 * @li an empty string can be passed as an attached long option argument: <code> --option-name= </code>.
 *     Note the distinction between an empty string as argument and no argument at all.
 * @li an empty string is permitted as separate argument to both long and short options.
 * @li Arguments to both short and long options may start with a @c '-' character. E.g.
 *     <code> -X-X </code>, <code>-X -X</code> or <code> --long-X=-X </code>. If @c -X
 *     and @c --long-X take an argument, that argument will be @c "-X" in all 3 cases.
 * @li If using the built-in @ref option::Arg::Optional "Arg::Optional", optional arguments must
 *     be attached.
 * @li the special option @c -- (i.e. without a name) terminates the list of
 *     options. Everything that follows is a non-option argument, even if it starts with
 *     a @c '-' character. The @c -- itself will not appear in the parse results.
 * @li the first argument that doesn't start with @c '-' or @c '--' and does not belong to
 *     a preceding argument-taking option, will terminate the option list and is the
 *     first non-option argument. All following command line arguments are treated as
 *     non-option arguments, even if they start with @c '-' . @n
 *     NOTE: This behaviour is mandated by POSIX, but GNU getopt() only honours this if it is
 *     explicitly requested (e.g. by setting POSIXLY_CORRECT). @n
 *     You can enable the GNU behaviour by passing @c true as first argument to
 *     e.g. @ref option::Parser::parse() "Parser::parse()".
 * @li Arguments that look like options (i.e. @c '-' followed by at least 1 character) but
 *     aren't, are NOT treated as non-option arguments. They are treated as unknown options and
 *     are collected into a list of unknown options for error reporting. @n
 *     This means that in order to pass a first non-option
 *     argument beginning with the minus character it is required to use the
 *     @c -- special option, e.g.
 *     @code
 *     program -x -- --strange-filename
 *     @endcode
 *     In this example, @c --strange-filename is a non-option argument. If the @c --
 *     were omitted, it would be treated as an unknown option. @n
 *     See @ref option::Descriptor::longopt for information on how to collect unknown options.

   *            reorder arguments so that all non-options are at the end. This is the default behaviour
   *            of GNU getopt() but is not conforming to POSIX. @n
   *            Note, that once the argument vector has been reordered, the @c gnu flag will have
   *            no further effect on this argument vector. So it is enough to pass @c gnu==true when
   *            creating Stats.
   * @param usage Array of Descriptor objects that describe the options to support. The last entry
   *              of this array must have 0 in all fields.
   * @param argc The number of elements from @c argv that are to be parsed. If you pass -1, the number
   *             will be determined automatically. In that case the @c argv list must end with a NULL
   *             pointer.
   * @param argv The arguments to be parsed. If you pass -1 as @c argc the last pointer in the @c argv
   *             list must be NULL to mark the end.
   * @param options Each entry is the first element of a linked list of Options. Each new option
   *                that is parsed will be appended to the list specified by that Option's
   *                Descriptor::index. If an entry is not yet used (i.e. the Option is invalid),
   *                it will be replaced rather than appended to. @n
   *                The minimum length of this array is the greatest Descriptor::index value that
   *                occurs in @c usage @e PLUS ONE.
   * @param buffer Each argument that is successfully parsed (including unknown arguments, if they
   *        have a Descriptor whose CheckArg does not return @ref ARG_ILLEGAL) will be stored in this
   *        array. parse() scans the array for the first invalid entry and begins writing at that
   *        index. You can pass @c bufmax to limit the number of options stored.
   * @param min_abbr_len Passing a value <code> min_abbr_len > 0 </code> enables abbreviated long
   *               options. The parser will match a prefix of a long option as if it was
   *               the full long option (e.g. @c --foob=10 will be interpreted as if it was
   *               @c --foobar=10 ), as long as the prefix has at least @c min_abbr_len characters
   *               (not counting the @c -- ) and is unambiguous.
   *               @n Be careful if combining @c min_abbr_len=1 with @c single_minus_longopt=true
   *               because the ambiguity check does not consider short options and abbreviated
   *               single minus long options will take precedence over short options.
   * @param single_minus_longopt Passing @c true for this option allows long options to begin with
   *               a single minus. The double minus form will still be recognized. Note that
   *               single minus long options take precedence over short options and short option
   *               groups. E.g. @c -file would be interpreted as @c --file and not as
   *               <code> -f -i -l -e </code> (assuming a long option named @c "file" exists).
   * @param bufmax The greatest index in the @c buffer[] array that parse() will write to is
   *               @c bufmax-1. If there are more options, they will be processed (in particular
   *               their CheckArg will be called) but not stored. @n
   *               If you used Stats::buffer_max to dimension this array, you can pass
   *               -1 (or not pass @c bufmax at all) which tells parse() that the buffer is
   *               "large enough".
   * @attention
   * Remember that @c options and @c buffer store Option @e objects, not pointers. Therefore it
   * is not possible for the same object to be in both arrays. For those options that are found in
   * both @c buffer[] and @c options[] the respective objects are independent copies. And only the
   * objects in @c options[] are properly linked via Option::next() and Option::prev().
   * You can iterate over @c buffer[] to
   * process all options in the order they appear in the argument vector, but if you want access to
   * the other Options with the same Descriptor::index, then you @e must access the linked list via
   * @c options[]. You can get the linked list in options from a buffer object via something like

   * @internal
   * @brief Splits a @c Descriptor[] array into tables, rows, lines and columns and
   * iterates over these components.
   *
   * The top-level organizational unit is the @e table.
   * A table begins at a Descriptor with @c help!=NULL and extends up to
   * a Descriptor with @c help==NULL.
   *
   * A table consists of @e rows. Due to line-wrapping and explicit breaks
   * a row may take multiple lines on screen. Rows within the table are separated
   * by \\n. They never cross Descriptor boundaries. This means a row ends either
   * at \\n or the 0 at the end of the help string.
   *
   * A row consists of columns/cells. Columns/cells within a row are separated by \\t.
   * Line breaks within a cell are marked by \\v.
   *
   * Rows in the same table need not have the same number of columns/cells. The
   * extreme case are interjections, which are rows that contain neither \\t nor \\v.
   * These are NOT treated specially by LinePartIterator, but they are treated
   * specially by printUsage().
   *
   * LinePartIterator iterates through the usage at 3 levels: table, row and part.
   * Tables and rows are as described above. A @e part is a line within a cell.
   * LinePartIterator iterates through 1st parts of all cells, then through the 2nd
   * parts of all cells (if any),... @n
   * Example: The row <code> "1 \v 3 \t 2 \v 4" </code> has 2 cells/columns and 4 parts.
   * The parts will be returned in the order 1, 2, 3, 4.
   *
   * It is possible that some cells have fewer parts than others. In this case
   * LinePartIterator will "fill up" these cells with 0-length parts. IOW, LinePartIterator
   * always returns the same number of parts for each column. Note that this is different
   * from the way rows and columns are handled. LinePartIterator does @e not guarantee that
   * the same number of columns will be returned for each row.

/**
 * @brief Outputs a nicely formatted usage string with support for multi-column formatting
 * and line-wrapping.
 *
 * printUsage() takes the @c help texts of a Descriptor[] array and formats them into
 * a usage message, wrapping lines to achieve the desired output width.
 *
 * <b>Table formatting:</b>
 *
 * Aside from plain strings which are simply line-wrapped, the usage may contain tables. Tables
 * are used to align elements in the output.
 *
 * @code
 * // Without a table. The explanatory texts are not aligned.
 * -c, --create  |Creates something.
 * -k, --kill  |Destroys something.
 *
 * // With table formatting. The explanatory texts are aligned.
 * -c, --create  |Creates something.
 * -k, --kill    |Destroys something.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Table formatting removes the need to pad help texts manually with spaces to achieve
 * alignment. To create a table, simply insert \\t (tab) characters to separate the cells
 * within a row.
 *
 * @code
 * const option::Descriptor usage[] = {
 * {..., "-c, --create  \tCreates something." },
 * {..., "-k, --kill  \tDestroys something." }, ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that you must include the minimum amount of space desired between cells yourself.
 * Table formatting will insert further spaces as needed to achieve alignment.
 *
 * You can insert line breaks within cells by using \\v (vertical tab).
 *
 * @code
 * const option::Descriptor usage[] = {
 * {..., "-c,\v--create  \tCreates\vsomething." },
 * {..., "-k,\v--kill  \tDestroys\vsomething." }, ...
 *
 * // results in
 *
 * -c,       Creates
 * --create  something.
 * -k,       Destroys
 * --kill    something.
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can mix lines that do not use \\t or \\v with those that do. The plain
 * lines will not mess up the table layout. Alignment of the table columns will
 * be maintained even across these interjections.
 *
 * @code
 * const option::Descriptor usage[] = {
 * {..., "-c, --create  \tCreates something." },
 * {..., "----------------------------------" },
 * {..., "-k, --kill  \tDestroys something." }, ...
 *
 * // results in
 *
 * -c, --create  Creates something.
 * ----------------------------------
 * -k, --kill    Destroys something.
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can have multiple tables within the same usage whose columns are
 * aligned independently. Simply insert a dummy Descriptor with @c help==0.
 *
 * @code
 * const option::Descriptor usage[] = {
 * {..., "Long options:" },
 * {..., "--very-long-option  \tDoes something long." },
 * {..., "--ultra-super-mega-long-option  \tTakes forever to complete." },
 * {..., 0 }, // ---------- table break -----------
 * {..., "Short options:" },
 * {..., "-s  \tShort." },
 * {..., "-q  \tQuick." }, ...
 *
 * // results in
 *
 * Long options:
 * --very-long-option              Does something long.
 * --ultra-super-mega-long-option  Takes forever to complete.
 * Short options:
 * -s  Short.
 * -q  Quick.
 *
 * // Without the table break it would be
 *
 * Long options:
 * --very-long-option              Does something long.
 * --ultra-super-mega-long-option  Takes forever to complete.
 * Short options:
 * -s                              Short.
 * -q                              Quick.
 * @endcode
 *
 * <b>Output methods:</b>
 *
 * Because TheLeanMeanC++Option parser is freestanding, you have to provide the means for
 * output in the first argument(s) to printUsage(). Because printUsage() is implemented as
 * a set of template functions, you have great flexibility in your choice of output
 * method. The following example demonstrates typical uses. Anything that's similar enough
 * will work.
 *
 * @code
 * #include <unistd.h>  // write()
 * #include <iostream>  // cout
 * #include <sstream>   // ostringstream
 * #include <cstdio>    // fwrite()
 * using namespace std;
 *
 * void my_write(const char* str, int size) {
 *   fwrite(str, size, 1, stdout);
 * }
 *
 * struct MyWriter {
 *   void write(const char* buf, size_t size) const {
 *      fwrite(str, size, 1, stdout);
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * struct MyWriteFunctor {
 *   void operator()(const char* buf, size_t size) {
 *      fwrite(str, size, 1, stdout);
 *   }
 * };
 * ...
 * printUsage(my_write, usage);    // custom write function
 * printUsage(MyWriter(), usage);  // temporary of a custom class
 * MyWriter writer;
 * printUsage(writer, usage);      // custom class object
 * MyWriteFunctor wfunctor;
 * printUsage(&wfunctor, usage);   // custom functor
 * printUsage(write, 1, usage);    // write() to file descriptor 1
 * printUsage(cout, usage);        // an ostream&
 * printUsage(fwrite, stdout, usage);  // fwrite() to stdout
 * ostringstream sstr;
 * printUsage(sstr, usage);        // an ostringstream&
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Notes:
 * @li the @c write() method of a class that is to be passed as a temporary
 *     as @c MyWriter() is in the example, must be a @c const method, because
 *     temporary objects are passed as const reference. This only applies to
 *     temporary objects that are created and destroyed in the same statement.
 *     If you create an object like @c writer in the example, this restriction
 *     does not apply.
 * @li a functor like @c MyWriteFunctor in the example must be passed as a pointer.
 *     This differs from the way functors are passed to e.g. the STL algorithms.
 * @li All printUsage() templates are tiny wrappers around a shared non-template implementation.
 *     So there's no penalty for using different versions in the same program.
 * @li printUsage() always interprets Descriptor::help as UTF-8 and always produces UTF-8-encoded
 *     output. If your system uses a different charset, you must do your own conversion. You
 *     may also need to change the font of the console to see non-ASCII characters properly.
 *     This is particularly true for Windows.
 * @li @b Security @b warning: Do not insert untrusted strings (such as user-supplied arguments)
 *     into the usage. printUsage() has no protection against malicious UTF-8 sequences.
 *
 * @param prn The output method to use. See the examples above.
 * @param usage the Descriptor[] array whose @c help texts will be formatted.
 * @param width the maximum number of characters per output line. Note that this number is
 *        in actual characters, not bytes. printUsage() supports UTF-8 in @c help and will
 *        count multi-byte UTF-8 sequences properly. Asian wide characters are counted
 *        as 2 characters.
 * @param last_column_min_percent (0-100) The minimum percentage of @c width that should be available
 *        for the last column (which typically contains the textual explanation of an option).
 *        If less space is available, the last column will be printed on its own line, indented
 *        according to @c last_column_own_line_max_percent.
 * @param last_column_own_line_max_percent (0-100) If the last column is printed on its own line due to
 *        less than @c last_column_min_percent of the width being available, then only
 *        @c last_column_own_line_max_percent of the extra line(s) will be used for the
 *        last column's text. This ensures an indentation. See example below.
 *
 * @code
 * // width=20, last_column_min_percent=50 (i.e. last col. min. width=10)
 * --3456789 1234567890
 *           1234567890
 *
 * // width=20, last_column_min_percent=75 (i.e. last col. min. width=15)
 * // last_column_own_line_max_percent=75
 * --3456789
 *      123456789012345
 *      67890
 *
 * // width=20, last_column_min_percent=75 (i.e. last col. min. width=15)
 * // last_column_own_line_max_percent=33 (i.e. max. 5)
 * --3456789
 *                12345
 *                67890
 *                12345
 *                67890
