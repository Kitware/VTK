/** \defgroup datasets NetCDF File and Data I/O

NetCDF opens datasets as files or remote access URLs.

A netCDF dataset that has not yet been opened can only be referred to
by its dataset name. Once a netCDF dataset is opened, it is referred
to by a netCDF ID, which is a small non-negative integer returned when
you create or open the dataset. A netCDF ID is much like a file
descriptor in C or a logical unit number in FORTRAN. In any single
program, the netCDF IDs of distinct open netCDF datasets are
distinct. A single netCDF dataset may be opened multiple times and
will then have multiple distinct netCDF IDs; however at most one of
the open instances of a single netCDF dataset should permit
writing. When an open netCDF dataset is closed, the ID is no longer
associated with a netCDF dataset.

Functions that deal with the netCDF library include:
- Get version of library.
- Get error message corresponding to a returned error code.

The operations supported on a netCDF dataset as a single object are:
- Create, given dataset name and whether to overwrite or not.
- Open for access, given dataset name and read or write intent.
- Put into define mode, to add dimensions, variables, or attributes.
- Take out of define mode, checking consistency of additions.
- Close, writing to disk if required.
- Inquire about the number of dimensions, number of variables,
number of global attributes, and ID of the unlimited dimension, if
any.
- Synchronize to disk to make sure it is current.
- Set and unset nofill mode for optimized sequential writes.
- After a summary of conventions used in describing the netCDF
interfaces, the rest of this chapter presents a detailed description
of the interfaces for these operations.

/**  \ingroup datasets
Create a new netCDF file.

This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID that
can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other
netCDF function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access
and placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables,
and attributes.

\param path The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

\param cmode The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
  NC_CLOBBER (overwrite existing file),
  NC_NOCLOBBER (do not overwrite existing file),
  NC_SHARE (limit write caching - netcdf classic files only),
  NC_64BIT_OFFSET (create 64-bit offset file),
  NC_64BIT_DATA (alias NC_CDF5) (create CDF-5 file),
  NC_NETCDF4 (create netCDF-4/HDF5 file),
  NC_CLASSIC_MODEL (enforce netCDF classic mode on netCDF-4/HDF5 files),
  NC_DISKLESS (store data in memory), and
  NC_PERSIST (force the NC_DISKLESS data from memory to a file),
  NC_MMAP (use MMAP for NC_DISKLESS instead of NC_INMEMORY -- deprecated).
  See discussion below.

\param ncidp Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be
stored.

<h2>The cmode Flag</h2>

The cmode flag is used to control the type of file created, and some
aspects of how it may be used.

Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite) an
existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the specified
dataset already exists.

The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing the
dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially may
see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag. This
flag is ignored for netCDF-4 files.

Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset format
file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit offset
format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e. over 2 GB)
data files. See Large File Support.

Setting NC_64BIT_DATA (alias NC_CDF5) causes netCDF to create a CDF-5
file format that supports large files (i.e. over 2GB) and large
variables (over 2B array elements.). See Large File Support.

A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset will be
in netCDF classic format. See NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

Setting NC_NETCDF4 causes netCDF to create a HDF5/NetCDF-4 file.

Setting NC_CLASSIC_MODEL causes netCDF to enforce the classic data
model in this file. (This only has effect for netCDF-4/HDF5 files, as
CDF-1, 2 and 5 files always use the classic model.) When
used with NC_NETCDF4, this flag ensures that the resulting
netCDF-4/HDF5 file may never contain any new constructs from the
enhanced data model. That is, it cannot contain groups, user defined
types, multiple unlimited dimensions, or new atomic types. The
advantage of this restriction is that such files are guaranteed to
work with existing netCDF software.

Setting NC_DISKLESS causes netCDF to create the file only in
memory and to optionally write the final contents to the
correspondingly named disk file. This allows for the use of
files that have no long term purpose. Operating on an existing file
in memory may also be faster. The decision on whether
or not to "persist" the memory contents to a disk file is
described in detail in the file docs/inmemory.md, which is
definitive.  By default, closing a diskless fill will cause it's
contents to be lost.

If NC_DISKLESS is going to be used for creating a large classic
file, it behooves one to use nc__create and specify an
appropriately large value of the initialsz parameter to avoid to
many extensions to the in-memory space for the file.  This flag
applies to files in classic format and to file in extended
format (netcdf-4).

Note that nc_create(path,cmode,ncidp) is equivalent to the invocation of
nc__create(path,cmode,NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT,NULL,ncidp).

\returns ::NC_NOERR No error.
\returns ::NC_EEXIST Specifying a file name of a file that exists and also specifying NC_NOCLOBBER.
\returns ::NC_EPERM Attempting to create a netCDF file in a directory where you do not have permission to create files.
\returns ::NC_ENOMEM System out of memory.
\returns ::NC_ENFILE Too many files open.
\returns ::NC_EHDFERR HDF5 error (netCDF-4 files only).
\returns ::NC_EFILEMETA Error writing netCDF-4 file-level metadata in
HDF5 file. (netCDF-4 files only).
\returns ::NC_EDISKLESS if there was an error in creating the
in-memory file.

\note When creating a netCDF-4 file HDF5 error reporting is turned
off, if it is on. This doesn't stop the HDF5 error stack from
recording the errors, it simply stops their display to the user
through stderr.

<h1>Examples</h1>

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
that name does not already exist:

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc. It will
be in the 64-bit offset format.

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_large.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_64BIT_OFFSET, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_HDF5.nc. It will
be in the HDF5 format.

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named
foo_HDF5_classic.nc. It will be in the HDF5 format, but will not allow
the use of any netCDF-4 advanced features. That is, it will conform to
the classic netCDF-3 data model.

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5_classic.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4|NC_CLASSIC_MODEL, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

In this example we create an in-memory netCDF classic dataset named
diskless.nc whose content will be lost when nc_close() is called.

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("diskless.nc", NC_DISKLESS, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

In this example we create a in-memory netCDF classic dataset named
diskless.nc and specify that it should be made persistent
in a file named diskless.nc when nc_close() is called.

@code
     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("diskless.nc", NC_DISKLESS|NC_PERSIST, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
@endcode

 *
 * <h2>Open Mode</h2>
 *
 * A zero value (or ::NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
 * the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
 * for efficiency.
 *
 * Otherwise, the open mode is ::NC_WRITE, ::NC_SHARE, or
 * ::NC_WRITE|::NC_SHARE. Setting the ::NC_WRITE flag opens the
 * dataset with read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change
 * to the dataset, including appending or changing data, adding or
 * renaming dimensions, variables, and attributes, or deleting
 * attributes.)
 *
 * The NC_SHARE flag is only used for netCDF classic
 * files. It is appropriate when one process may be writing the
 * dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
 * concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
 * caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
 * sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
 * may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.
 *
 * This procedure may also be invoked with the NC_DISKLESS flag set in
 * the omode argument if the file to be opened is a classic format
 * file.  For nc_open(), this flag applies only to files in classic
 * format.  If the file is of type NC_NETCDF4, then the NC_DISKLESS
 * flag will be ignored.
 *
 * If NC_DISKLESS is specified, then the whole file is read completely
 * into memory. In effect this creates an in-memory cache of the file.
 * If the omode flag also specifies NC_PERSIST, then the in-memory cache
 * will be re-written to the disk file when nc_close() is called.  For
 * some kinds of manipulations, having the in-memory cache can speed
 * up file processing. But in simple cases, non-cached processing may
 * actually be faster than using cached processing.  You will need to
 * experiment to determine if the in-memory caching is worthwhile for
 * your application.
 *
 * Normally, NC_DISKLESS allocates space in the heap for storing the
 * in-memory file. If, however, the ./configure flags --enable-mmap is
 * used, and the additional omode flag NC_MMAP is specified, then the
 * file will be opened using the operating system MMAP facility.  This
 * flag only applies to files in classic format. Extended format
 * (netcdf-4) files will ignore the NC_MMAP flag.
 *
 * In most cases, using MMAP provides no advantage for just
 * NC_DISKLESS. The one case where using MMAP is an advantage is when
 * a file is to be opened and only a small portion of its data is to
 * be read and/or written.  In this scenario, MMAP will cause only the
 * accessed data to be retrieved from disk. Without MMAP, NC_DISKLESS
 * will read the whole file into memory on nc_open. Thus, MMAP will
 * provide some performance improvement in this case.
 *
 * It is not necessary to pass any information about the format of the
 * file being opened. The file type will be detected automatically by
 * the netCDF library.
 *
 * If a the path is a DAP URL, then the open mode is read-only.
 * Setting NC_WRITE will be ignored.
 *
 * As of version 4.3.1.2, multiple calls to nc_open with the same
 * path will return the same ncid value.
 *
 * @note When opening a netCDF-4 file HDF5 error reporting is turned
 * off, if it is on. This doesn't stop the HDF5 error stack from
 * recording the errors, it simply stops their display to the user
 * through stderr.
 *

For netCDF-4 files (i.e. files created with NC_NETCDF4 in the cmode in
their call to nc_create()), it is not necessary to call nc_redef()
unless the file was also created with NC_STRICT_NC3. For straight-up
netCDF-4 files, nc_redef() is called automatically, as needed.

For all netCDF-4 files, the root ncid must be used. This is the ncid
returned by nc_open() and nc_create(), and points to the root of the
hierarchy tree for netCDF-4 files.

/** \ingroup datasets
Leave define mode

The function nc_enddef() takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems
occurred. Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as
well with nc_set_fill(). The netCDF dataset is then placed in data
mode, so variable data can be read or written.

It's not necessary to call nc_enddef() for netCDF-4 files. With netCDF-4
files, nc_enddef() is called when needed by the netcdf-4 library. User
calls to nc_enddef() for netCDF-4 files still flush the metadata to
disk.

This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see File Structure and Performance.

For netCDF-4/HDF5 format files there are some variable settings (the
compression, endianness, fletcher32 error correction, and fill value)
which must be set (if they are going to be set at all) between the
nc_def_var() and the next nc_enddef(). Once the nc_enddef() is called,
these settings can no longer be changed for a variable.

\param ncid NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open() or

If you use a group id (in a netCDF-4/HDF5 file), the enddef

define mode in one group, but in the entire file.

Leave define mode with performance tuning

The function nc__enddef takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems
occurred. Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as
well with nc_set_fill(). The netCDF dataset is then placed in data mode,
so variable data can be read or written.

This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see File Structure and Performance.

\warning This function exposes internals of the netcdf version 1 file
format. Users should use nc_enddef() in most circumstances. This
function may not be available on future netcdf implementations.

The classic netcdf file format has three sections, the "header"
section, the data section for fixed size variables, and the data
section for variables which have an unlimited dimension (record
variables).

The header begins at the beginning of the file. The index (offset) of
the beginning of the other two sections is contained in the
header. Typically, there is no space between the sections. This causes
copying overhead to accrue if one wishes to change the size of the
sections, as may happen when changing names of things, text attribute
values, adding attributes or adding variables. Also, for buffered i/o,
there may be advantages to aligning sections in certain ways.

The minfree parameters allow one to control costs of future calls to
nc_redef, nc_enddef() by requesting that minfree bytes be available at
the end of the section.

The align parameters allow one to set the alignment of the beginning
of the corresponding sections. The beginning of the section is rounded
up to an index which is a multiple of the align parameter. The flag
value ALIGN_CHUNK tells the library to use the bufrsize (see above) as
the align parameter. It has nothing to do with the chunking
(multidimensional tiling) features of netCDF-4.

The file format requires mod 4 alignment, so the align parameters are
silently rounded up to multiples of 4. The usual call,

\code
     nc_enddef(ncid);
\endcode

is equivalent to

\code
     nc__enddef(ncid, 0, 4, 0, 4);
\endcode

The file format does not contain a "record size" value, this is
calculated from the sizes of the record variables. This unfortunate
fact prevents us from providing minfree and alignment control of the
"records" in a netcdf file. If you add a variable which has an
unlimited dimension, the third section will always be copied with the
new variable added.

\param ncid NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open() or
nc_create().

\param h_minfree Sets the pad at the end of the "header" section.

\param v_align Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data
section for fixed size variables.

variables).

/** \ingroup datasets
Synchronize an open netcdf dataset to disk

The function nc_sync() offers a way to synchronize the disk copy of a
netCDF dataset with in-memory buffers. There are two reasons you might
want to synchronize after writes:
- To minimize data loss in case of abnormal termination, or
- To make data available to other processes for reading immediately
  after it is written. But note that a process that already had the
  dataset open for reading would not see the number of records
  increase when the writing process calls nc_sync(); to accomplish this,
  the reading process must call nc_sync.

This function is backward-compatible with previous versions of the
netCDF library. The intent was to allow sharing of a netCDF dataset
among multiple readers and one writer, by having the writer call
nc_sync() after writing and the readers call nc_sync() before each
read. For a writer, this flushes buffers to disk. For a reader, it
makes sure that the next read will be from disk rather than from
previously cached buffers, so that the reader will see changes made by
the writing process (e.g., the number of records written) without
having to close and reopen the dataset. If you are only accessing a
small amount of data, it can be expensive in computer resources to
always synchronize to disk after every write, since you are giving up
the benefits of buffering.

An easier way to accomplish sharing (and what is now recommended) is
to have the writer and readers open the dataset with the NC_SHARE
flag, and then it will not be necessary to call nc_sync() at
all. However, the nc_sync() function still provides finer granularity
than the NC_SHARE flag, if only a few netCDF accesses need to be
synchronized among processes.

It is important to note that changes to the ancillary data, such as
attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of the
NC_SHARE flag. Use of the nc_sync() function is still required for this
purpose.

Sharing datasets when the writer enters define mode to change the data
schema requires extra care. In previous releases, after the writer
left define mode, the readers were left looking at an old copy of the
dataset, since the changes were made to a new copy. The only way
readers could see the changes was by closing and reopening the
dataset. Now the changes are made in place, but readers have no
knowledge that their internal tables are now inconsistent with the new
dataset schema. If netCDF datasets are shared across redefinition,
some mechanism external to the netCDF library must be provided that
prevents access by readers during redefinition and causes the readers
to call nc_sync before any subsequent access.

When calling nc_sync(), the netCDF dataset must be in data mode. A
netCDF dataset in define mode is synchronized to disk only when
nc_enddef() is called. A process that is reading a netCDF dataset that
another process is writing may call nc_sync to get updated with the
changes made to the data by the writing process (e.g., the number of
records written), without having to close and reopen the dataset.

Data is automatically synchronized to disk when a netCDF dataset is
closed, or whenever you leave define mode.

/** \ingroup datasets
Change the fill-value mode to improve write performance.

This function is intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
some circumstances described below. The function nc_set_fill() sets the
fill mode for a netCDF dataset open for writing and returns the
current fill mode in a return parameter. The fill mode can be
specified as either ::NC_FILL or ::NC_NOFILL. The default behavior
corresponding to ::NC_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values,
that is fill values are written when you create non-record variables
or when you write a value beyond data that has not yet been
written. This makes it possible to detect attempts to read data before
it was written. For more information on the use of fill values see
Fill Values. For information about how to define your own fill values
see Attribute Conventions.

The behavior corresponding to ::NC_NOFILL overrides the default behavior
of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to enhance
performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur when
the netCDF library writes fill values that are later overwritten with
data.

A value indicating which mode the netCDF dataset was already in is
returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode
of an open netCDF dataset and then restore it to the previous mode.

After you turn on ::NC_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF dataset, you must
be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will later be
read. Note that nofill mode is only a transient property of a netCDF
dataset open for writing: if you close and reopen the dataset, it will
revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the default
behavior by calling nc_set_fill() again to explicitly set the fill mode
to ::NC_FILL.

There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill
mode:
- Creating and initializing a netCDF dataset. In this case, you should
  set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef() and then write completely
  all non-record variables and the initial records of all the record
  variables you want to initialize.
- Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF dataset. Set nofill
  mode after opening the dataset for writing, then append the
  additional records to the dataset completely, leaving no intervening
  unwritten records.
- Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an existing
  netCDF dataset. Set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef() then write
  all the new variables completely.

If the netCDF dataset has an unlimited dimension and the last record
was written while in nofill mode, then the dataset may be shorter than
if nofill mode was not set, but this will be completely transparent if
you access the data only through the netCDF interfaces.

The use of this feature may not be available (or even needed) in
future releases. Programmers are cautioned against heavy reliance upon
this feature.

netcdf.h in the list of atomic types (NC_CHAR, NC_INT, etc.).

\param name If non-NULL, the name of the user defined type will be
copied here. It will be NC_MAX_NAME bytes or less. For atomic types,
the type name from CDL will be given.

\param size If non-NULL, the (in-memory) size of the type in bytes
will be copied here. VLEN type size is the size of nc_vlen_t. String
size is returned as the size of a character pointer. The size may be
used to malloc space for the data, no matter what the type.
