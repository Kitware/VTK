netcdfcpp.h	the C++ interface

netcdf.cpp	the implementation of the interface, on top of the current
                C library interface

nctst.cpp	a test program for the interface that creates a netCDF file
                and then dumps out its contents in ASCII form to stdout.
                This example may also be helpful in understanding how the
                interface is intended to be used.

example.c	example of C code needed to create a small netCDF file

example.cpp	analogous example of C++ code needed to do the same thing

Makefile	makefile for building nctst

ncvalues.cpp	interface for auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
                netCDF interface; fairly simple

ncvalues.cpp	implementation of auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
                netCDF interface
