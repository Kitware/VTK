 * @class   vtkTreeCompositer
 * @brief   Implements tree based compositing.
 *
 *
 * vtkTreeCompositer operates in multiple processes.  Each compositer has
 * a render window.  They use a vtkMultiProcessController to communicate
 * the color and depth buffer to process 0's render window.
 * It will not handle transparency well.
