/**
 * @class   vtkFixedPointRayCastImage
 * @brief   helper class for a ray cast image
 *
 * This is a helper class for storing the ray cast image including the
 * underlying data and the size of the image. This class is not intended
 * to be used directly - just as an internal class in the
 * vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper so that multiple mappers can share
 * the same image. This class also stored the ZBuffer (if necessary due
 * to intermixed geometry). Perhaps this class could be generalized
 * in the future to be used for other ray cast methods other than the
 * fixed point method.
