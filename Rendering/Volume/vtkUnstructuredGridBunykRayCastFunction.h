/**
 * @class   vtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction
 * @brief   a superclass for ray casting functions
 *
 *
 * vtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction is a concrete implementation of a
 * ray cast function for unstructured grid data. This class was based on the
 * paper "Simple, Fast, Robust Ray Casting of Irregular Grids" by Paul Bunyk,
 * Arie Kaufmna, and Claudio Silva. This method is quite memory intensive
 * (with extra explicit copies of the data) and therefore should not be used
 * for very large data. This method assumes that the input data is composed
 * entirely of tetras - use vtkDataSetTriangleFilter before setting the input
 * on the mapper.
 *
 * The basic idea of this method is as follows:
 *
 *   1) Enumerate the triangles. At each triangle have space for some
 *      information that will be used during rendering. This includes
 *      which tetra the triangles belong to, the plane equation and the
 *      Barycentric coefficients.
 *
 *   2) Keep a reference to all four triangles for each tetra.
 *
 *   3) At the beginning of each render, do the precomputation. This
 *      includes creating an array of transformed points (in view
 *      coordinates) and computing the view dependent info per triangle
 *      (plane equations and barycentric coords in view space)
 *
 *   4) Find all front facing boundary triangles (a triangle is on the
 *      boundary if it belongs to only one tetra). For each triangle,
 *      find all pixels in the image that intersect the triangle, and
 *      add this to the sorted (by depth) intersection list at each
 *      pixel.
 *
 *   5) For each ray cast, traverse the intersection list. At each
 *      intersection, accumulate opacity and color contribution
 *      per tetra along the ray until you reach an exiting triangle
 *      (on the boundary).
