/**
 * @class   vtkActor
 * @brief   represents an object (geometry & properties) in a rendered scene
 *
 *
 * vtkActor is used to represent an entity in a rendering scene.  It inherits
 * functions related to the actors position, and orientation from
 * vtkProp. The actor also has scaling and maintains a reference to the
 * defining geometry (i.e., the mapper), rendering properties, and possibly a
 * texture map. vtkActor combines these instance variables into one 4x4
 * transformation matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1] Translate(-origin)
 * Scale(scale) Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin) Trans(position)
