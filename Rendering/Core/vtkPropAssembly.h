/**
 * @class   vtkPropAssembly
 * @brief   create hierarchies of props
 *
 * vtkPropAssembly is an object that groups props and other prop assemblies
 * into a tree-like hierarchy. The props can then be treated as a group
 * (e.g., turning visibility on and off).
 *
 * A vtkPropAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkProp since it is a
 * subclass of vtkProp. The difference is that vtkPropAssembly maintains a
 * list of other prop and prop assembly instances (its "parts") that form the
 * assembly. Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups
 * consisting of prop assemblies to arbitrary depth.
 *
 * vtkPropAssembly's and vtkProp's that compose a prop assembly need not be
 * added to a renderer's list of props, as long as the parent assembly is in
 * the prop list. This is because they are automatically renderered during
 * the hierarchical traversal process.
 *
 * @warning
 * vtkPropAssemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one
 * actor or assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other
 * hierarchies. However, make that there are no cycles (e.g.,
 * parent->child->parent), this will cause program failure.
