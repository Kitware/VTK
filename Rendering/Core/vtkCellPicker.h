/**
 * @class   vtkCellPicker
 * @brief   ray-cast cell picker for all kinds of Prop3Ds
 *
 * vtkCellPicker will shoot a ray into a 3D scene and return information
 * about the first object that the ray hits.  It works for all Prop3Ds.
 * For vtkVolume objects, it shoots a ray into the volume and returns
 * the point where the ray intersects an isosurface of a chosen opacity.
 * For vtkImage objects, it intersects the ray with the displayed
 * slice. For vtkActor objects, it intersects the actor's polygons.
 * If the object's mapper has ClippingPlanes, then it takes the clipping
 * into account, and will return the Id of the clipping plane that was
 * intersected.
 * For all prop types, it returns point and cell information, plus the
 * normal of the surface that was intersected at the pick position.  For
 * volumes and images, it also returns (i,j,k) coordinates for the point
 * and the cell that were picked.

 * as an enhancement to the original vtkCellPicker.
