/**
 * @class   vtkPicker
 * @brief   superclass for 3D geometric pickers (uses ray cast)
 *
 * vtkPicker is used to select instances of vtkProp3D by shooting a ray
 * into a graphics window and intersecting with the actor's bounding box.
 * The ray is defined from a point defined in window (or pixel) coordinates,
 * and a point located from the camera's position.
 *
 * vtkPicker may return more than one vtkProp3D, since more than one bounding
 * box may be intersected. vtkPicker returns an unsorted list of props that
 * were hit, and a list of the corresponding world points of the hits.
 * For the vtkProp3D that is closest to the camera, vtkPicker returns the
 * pick coordinates in world and untransformed mapper space, the prop itself,
 * the data set, and the mapper.  For vtkPicker the closest prop is the one
 * whose center point (i.e., center of bounding box) projected on the view
 * ray is closest to the camera.  Subclasses of vtkPicker use other methods
 * for computing the pick point.
 *
 * @sa
 * vtkPicker is used for quick geometric picking. If you desire more precise
 * picking of points or cells based on the geometry of any vtkProp3D, use the
 * subclasses vtkPointPicker or vtkCellPicker.  For hardware-accelerated
 * picking of any type of vtkProp, use vtkPropPicker or vtkWorldPointPicker.
