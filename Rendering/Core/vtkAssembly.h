/**
 * @class   vtkAssembly
 * @brief   create hierarchies of vtkProp3Ds (transformable props)
 *
 * vtkAssembly is an object that groups vtkProp3Ds, its subclasses, and
 * other assemblies into a tree-like hierarchy. The vtkProp3Ds and
 * assemblies can then be transformed together by transforming just the root
 * assembly of the hierarchy.
 *
 * A vtkAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkProp3D since it is a
 * subclass of vtkProp3D. The difference is that vtkAssembly maintains a list
 * of vtkProp3D instances (its "parts") that form the assembly. Then, any
 * operation that transforms (i.e., scales, rotates, translates) the parent
 * assembly will transform all its parts.  Note that this process is
 * recursive: you can create groups consisting of assemblies and/or
 * vtkProp3Ds to arbitrary depth.
 *
 * To add an assembly to the renderer's list of props, you only need to
 * add the root of the assembly. During rendering, the parts of the
 * assembly are rendered during a hierarchical traversal process.
 *
 * @warning
 * Collections of assemblies are slower to render than an equivalent list
 * of actors. This is because to support arbitrary nesting of assemblies,
 * the state of the assemblies (i.e., transformation matrices) must
 * be propagated through the assembly hierarchy.
 *
 * @warning
 * Assemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one actor or
 * assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other hierarchies. However,
 * make that there are no cycles (e.g., parent->child->parent), this will
 * cause program failure.
 *
 * @warning
 * If you wish to create assemblies without any transformation (using the
 * assembly strictly as a grouping mechanism), then you may wish to
 * consider using vtkPropAssembly.
