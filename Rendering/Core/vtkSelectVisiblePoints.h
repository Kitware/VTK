/**
 * @class   vtkSelectVisiblePoints
 * @brief   extract points that are visible (based on z-buffer calculation)
 *
 * vtkSelectVisiblePoints is a filter that selects points based on
 * whether they are visible or not. Visibility is determined by
 * accessing the z-buffer of a rendering window. (The position of each
 * input point is converted into display coordinates, and then the
 * z-value at that point is obtained. If within the user-specified
 * tolerance, the point is considered visible.)
 *
 * Points that are visible (or if the ivar SelectInvisible is on,
 * invisible points) are passed to the output. Associated data
 * attributes are passed to the output as well.
 *
 * This filter also allows you to specify a rectangular window in display
 * (pixel) coordinates in which the visible points must lie. This can be
 * used as a sort of local "brushing" operation to select just data within
 * a window.
 *
 *
 * @warning
 * You must carefully synchronize the execution of this filter. The
 * filter refers to a renderer, which is modified every time a render
 * occurs. Therefore, the filter is always out of date, and always
 * executes. You may have to perform two rendering passes, or if you
 * are using this filter in conjunction with vtkLabeledDataMapper,
 * things work out because 2D rendering occurs after the 3D rendering.
