 * @class   vtkTexturedActor2D
 * @brief   actor that draws 2D data with texture support
 *
 * vtkTexturedActor2D is an Actor2D which has additional support for
 * textures, just like vtkActor. To use textures, the geometry must have
 * texture coordinates, and the texture must be set with SetTexture().
