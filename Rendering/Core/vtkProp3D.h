/**
 * @class   vtkProp3D
 * @brief   represents an 3D object for placement in a rendered scene
 *
 * vtkProp3D is an abstract class used to represent an entity in a rendering
 * scene (i.e., vtkProp3D is a vtkProp with an associated transformation
 * matrix).  It handles functions related to the position, orientation and
 * scaling. It combines these instance variables into one 4x4 transformation
 * matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1] Translate(-origin) Scale(scale)
 * Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin) Trans(position). Both vtkActor and
 * vtkVolume are specializations of class vtkProp.  The constructor defaults
 * to: origin(0,0,0) position=(0,0,0) orientation=(0,0,0), no user defined
 * matrix or transform, and no texture map.
