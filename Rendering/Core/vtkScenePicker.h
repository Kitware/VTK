/**
 * @class   vtkScenePicker
 * @brief   Picks an entire viewport at one shot.
 *
 * The Scene picker, unlike conventional pickers picks an entire viewport at
 * one shot and caches the result, which can be retrieved later.
 *    The utility of the class arises during <b>Actor Selection</b>. Let's
 * say you have a couple of polygonal objects in your scene and you wish to
 * have a status bar that indicates the object your mouse is over. Picking
 * repeatedly every time your mouse moves would be very slow. The
 * scene picker automatically picks your viewport every time the camera is
 * changed and caches the information. Additionally, it observes the
 * vtkRenderWindowInteractor to avoid picking during interaction, so that
 * you still maintain your interactivity. In effect, the picker does an
 * additional pick-render of your scene every time you stop interacting with
 * your scene. As an example, see Rendering/TestScenePicker.
 *
 * @warning
 * - Unlike a vtkHoverWidget, this class is not timer based. The hover widget
 *   picks a scene when the mouse is over an actor for a specified duration.
 * - This class uses a vtkHardwareSelector under the hood. Hence, it will
 *   work only for actors that have opaque geomerty and are rendered by a
 *   vtkPolyDataMapper.
