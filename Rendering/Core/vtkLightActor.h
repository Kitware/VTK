/**
 * @class   vtkLightActor
 * @brief   a cone and a frustum to represent a spotlight.
 *
 * vtkLightActor is a composite actor used to represent a spotlight. The cone
 * angle is equal to the spotlight angle, the cone apex is at the position of
 * the light, the direction of the light goes from the cone apex to the center
 * of the base of the cone. The square frustum position is the light position,
 * the frustum focal point is in the direction of the light direction. The
 * frustum vertical view angle (aperture) (this is also the horizontal view
 * angle as the frustum is square) is equal to twice the cone angle. The
 * clipping range of the frustum is arbitrary set by the user
 * (initially at 0.5,11.0).
 *
 * @warning
 * Right now only spotlight are supported but directional light might be
 * supported in the future.
