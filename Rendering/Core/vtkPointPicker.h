 * @class   vtkPointPicker
 * @brief   select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics window
 *
 *
 * vtkPointPicker is used to select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics
 * window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically its
 * points. Beside returning coordinates, actor, and mapper, vtkPointPicker
 * returns the id of the point projecting closest onto the ray (within the
 * specified tolerance).  Ties are broken (i.e., multiple points all
 * projecting within the tolerance along the pick ray) by choosing the point
 * closest to the ray.
