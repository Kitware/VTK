/**
 * @class   vtkAbstractPicker
 * @brief   define API for picking subclasses
 *
 * vtkAbstractPicker is an abstract superclass that defines a minimal API
 * for its concrete subclasses. The minimum functionality of a picker is
 * to return the x-y-z global coordinate position of a pick (the pick
 * itself is defined in display coordinates).
 *
 * The API to this class is to invoke the Pick() method with a selection
 * point (in display coordinates - pixels) and a renderer. Then get the
 * resulting pick position in global coordinates with the GetPickPosition()
 * method.
 *
 * vtkPicker fires events during the picking process.  These
 * events are StartPickEvent, PickEvent, and EndPickEvent which are
 * invoked prior to picking, when something is picked, and after all picking
 * candidates have been tested. Note that during the pick process the
 * PickEvent of vtkProp (and its subclasses such as vtkActor) is fired
 * prior to the PickEvent of vtkPicker.
 *
 * @warning
 * vtkAbstractPicker and its subclasses will not pick props that are
 * "unpickable" (see vtkProp) or are fully transparent (if transparency
 * is a property of the vtkProp).
 *
 * @warning
 * There are two classes of pickers: those that pick using geometric methods
 * (typically a ray cast); and those that use rendering hardware. Geometric
 * methods return more information but are slower. Hardware methods are much
 * faster and return minimal information. Examples of geometric pickers
 * include vtkPicker, vtkCellPicker, and vtkPointPicker. Examples of hardware
 * pickers include vtkWorldPointPicker and vtkPropPicker.
 *
 * @sa
 * vtkPropPicker uses hardware acceleration to pick an instance of vtkProp.
 * (This means that 2D and 3D props can be picked, and it's relatively fast.)
 * If you need to pick cells or points, you might wish to use vtkCellPicker
 * or vtkPointPicker. vtkWorldPointPicker is the fastest picker, returning
 * an x-y-z coordinate value using the hardware z-buffer. vtkPicker can be
 * used to pick the bounding box of 3D props.
