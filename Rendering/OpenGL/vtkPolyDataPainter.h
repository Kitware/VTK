/**
 * @class   vtkPolyDataPainter
 * @brief   Abstract class for drawing poly data.
 *
 *
 * vtkPolyDataPainter encapsulates a method of drawing poly data.  This is a subset
 * of what a mapper does.  The painter does no maintenance of the rendering
 * state (camera, lights, etc.).  It is solely responsible for issuing
 * rendering commands that build graphics primitives.
 *
 * To simplify coding, an implementation of vtkPolyDataPainter is allowed to support
 * only certain types of poly data or certain types of primitives.
