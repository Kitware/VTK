/**
 * @class   vtkCocoaRenderWindowInteractor
 * @brief   implements Cocoa specific functions
 * required by vtkRenderWindowInteractor.
 *
 *
 * The interactor interfaces with vtkCocoaRenderWindow and vtkCocoaGLView
 * to trap messages from the Cocoa window manager and send them to vtk.
 * Since OS X applications typically use the Command key where UNIX and
 * Windows applications would use the Ctrl key, this interactor maps the
 * Command key to Ctrl.  In versions of VTK prior to VTK 6.2, it was
 * mapped to Alt.  On OS X, the Option key can be used as Alt.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This header must be in C++ only because it is included by .cxx
 * files.  That means no Objective C may be used. That's why some instance
 * variables are void* instead of what they really should be.
