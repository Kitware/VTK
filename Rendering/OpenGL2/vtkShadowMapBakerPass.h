/**
 * @class   vtkShadowMapBakerPass
 * @brief   Implement a builder of shadow map pass.
 *
 * Bake a list of shadow maps, once per spot light.
 * It work in conjunction with the vtkShadowMapPass, which uses the
 * shadow maps for rendering the opaque geometry (a technique to render hard
 * shadows in hardware).
 *
 * This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
 * Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value and
 * background color/gradient/transparent color.
 * An opaque pass may have been performed right after the initialization.
 *
 *
 *
 * Its delegate is usually set to a vtkOpaquePass.
 *
 * @par Implementation:
 * The first pass of the algorithm is to generate a shadow map per light
 * (depth map from the light point of view) by rendering the opaque objects
 *
 * @sa
 * vtkRenderPass, vtkOpaquePass, vtkShadowMapPass
