/**
 * @class   vtkOpenGLFramebufferObject
 * @brief   Internal class which encapsulates OpenGL FramebufferObject
 *
 * Before delving into this class it is best to have some background
 * in some OpenGL terms. OpenGL has a notion of a currently
 * bound Framebuffers for drawing and reading. It can be the default
 * framebuffer such as created with a standard window/context or
 * it can be a user created Framebuffer objects. When draw and read
 * commands are invoked, they apply to the current draw and/or read
 * frambuffers.
 *
 * A framebuffer consists of color buffers and an optional depth buffer.
 * The FramebufferObject does not hold the memory for these buffers, it
 * just keeps track of what buffers are attached to it. The buffers themselves
 * hold the storage for the pixels/depths.
 *
 * In the context of this discussion a buffer can be either a
 * vtkTextureObject (both 2D or a slice of a 3D texture) or
 * a vtkRenderbuffer. In some cases a renderbuffer may be faster
 * or more lightweight but you cannot pass a renderbuffer into
 * a shader for sampling in a later pass like you can a texture.
 *
 * You attach these buffers to the Framebuffer using methods
 * such as AddColorAttachment or AddDepthAttachment
 * In normal usage a buffer is Attached to a FramebufferObject
 * and then some or all of the attached buffers are activated for drawing
 * or reading.
 *
 * When you have a framebuffer bound along with some buffers attached to it
 * you can then activate specific buffers for drawing or reading. So you
 * have draw and read framebuffer objects (bindings) and then for the currently
 * bound FramebufferObjects you have active draw and read buffers.
 *
 * A single FramebufferObject can be bound to both Draw and Read. Likewise
 * a single buffer can be activated for both draw and read operations. You
 * cannot assign and activate a TextureObject for drawing on the FO and
 * at the same time pass it in as a Texture to the shader program. That
 * type of operation is very common and must be done in two steps.
 *  - Render to the FO with the Texture attached as an active buffer
 *  - deactivate the texture obj and then render with the texture obj
 *    as a texture passed into the shader
 *
 * Typical use cases:
 * The simplest example
 *\code{.cpp}
 * fbo->SetContext(renWin);
 * fbo->SaveCurrentBindingsAndBuffers();
 * fbo->PopulateFramebuffer(width, height);
 * fbo->Start();
 *
 * ...
 *
 * fbo->RestorePreviousBindingsAndBuffers();
 *\endcode
 *
 * If you wish to use a texture you created
 *
 *\code{.cpp}
 * fbo->SetContext(renWin);
 * fbo->SaveCurrentBindingsAndBuffers();
 * fbo->Bind();
 * fbo->AddColorAttachment(0, vtkTextureObj);
 * fbo->AddDepthAttachment(); // auto create depth buffer
 * fbo->ActivateBuffer(0);
 * fbo->Start();
 *
 * ...
 *
 * fbo->RestorePreviousBindingsAndBuffers();
 *\endcode
 *
 * If you will be using a FO repeatedly then it is best to create it
 * attach the bufffers and then use as needed for example
 *
 * Typical use case:
 *\code{.cpp}
 * // setup the FBO once
 * fbo->SetContext(renWin);
 * fbo->SaveCurrentBindingsAndBuffers();
 * fbo->Bind();
 * fbo->AddColorAttachment(0, vtkTextureObj);
 * fbo->AddDepthAttachment(); // auto create depth buffer
 * fbo->RestorePreviousBindingsAndBuffers();
 *
 * // use it many times
 * fbo->SaveCurrentBindingsAndBuffers();
 * fbo->Bind();
 * fbo->ActivateBuffer(0);
 * fbo->Start();
 * ... // render here etc
 * fbo->RestorePreviousBindingsAndBuffers();
 *\endcode
 *
 * If you with to only bind/attach the draw buffers or read buffers there
 * are mode specific versions of most methods that only apply to the
 * mode specified Draw/Read/Both. The mode argument uses OpenGL constants
 * so this class provides convenience methods to return them named
 * GetDrawMode() GetReadMode() and GetBothMode() so that your code
 * does not need to be polluted with OpenGL headers/constants.
 *
 * This class replaces both vtkFrameBufferObject and vtkFrameBufferObject2
 * and contins methods from both of them. Most methods from FO2 should
 * work with this class. Just rename FBO2 to FBO and make sure to Save and
 * Restore the bindings and buffers.
 * If you have been using the old FO class, which had comments
 * in the header saying not to use it. Then you are in for a bit more of
 * a conversion but generally it should still be easy. Use the code
 * samples above (or any of the classes in OpenGL2 that currently use FBOs)
 * to guide you. They have all been converted to this class. Where previously
 * a DepthBuffer was autmatically created for you, you now need to do it
 * explicitly using AddDepthAttachment().
 *
 * This class should be named vtkOpenGLFramebufferObject (FO)
 * Note the capitalization of FramebufferObject
