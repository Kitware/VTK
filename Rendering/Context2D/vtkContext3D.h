 * @class   vtkContext3D
 * @brief   Class for drawing 3D primitives to a graphical context.
 *
 *
 * This defines the interface for drawing onto a 3D context. The context must
 * be set up with a vtkContextDevice3D derived class that provides the functions
 * to facilitate the low level calls to the context. Currently only an OpenGL
 * based device is provided.
