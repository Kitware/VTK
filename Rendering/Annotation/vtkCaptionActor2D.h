/**
 * @class   vtkCaptionActor2D
 * @brief   draw text label associated with a point
 *
 * vtkCaptionActor2D is a hybrid 2D/3D actor that is used to associate text
 * with a point (the AttachmentPoint) in the scene. The caption can be
 * drawn with a rectangular border and a leader connecting
 * the caption to the attachment point. Optionally, the leader can be
 * glyphed at its endpoint to create arrow heads or other indicators.
 *
 * To use the caption actor, you normally specify the Position and Position2
 * coordinates (these are inherited from the vtkActor2D superclass). (Note
 * that Position2 can be set using vtkActor2D's SetWidth() and SetHeight()
 * methods.)  Position and Position2 define the size of the caption, and a
 * third point, the AttachmentPoint, defines a point that the caption is
 * associated with.  You must also define the caption text,
 * whether you want a border around the caption, and whether you want a
 * leader from the caption to the attachment point. The font attributes of
 * the text can be set through the vtkTextProperty associated to this actor.
 * You also indicate whether you want
 * the leader to be 2D or 3D. (2D leaders are always drawn over the
 * underlying geometry. 3D leaders may be occluded by the geometry.) The
 * leader may also be terminated by an optional glyph (e.g., arrow).
 *
 * The trickiest part about using this class is setting Position, Position2,
 * and AttachmentPoint correctly. These instance variables are
 * vtkCoordinates, and can be set up in various ways. In default usage, the
 * AttachmentPoint is defined in the world coordinate system, Position is the
 * lower-left corner of the caption and relative to AttachmentPoint (defined
 * in display coordaintes, i.e., pixels), and Position2 is relative to
 * Position and is the upper-right corner (also in display
 * coordinates). However, the user has full control over the coordinates, and
 * can do things like place the caption in a fixed position in the renderer,
 * with the leader moving with the AttachmentPoint.
