 * @class   vtkDynamic2DLabelMapper
 * @brief   draw text labels at 2D dataset points
 *
 * vtkDynamic2DLabelMapper is a mapper that renders text at dataset
 * points such that the labels do not overlap.
 * Various items can be labeled including point ids, scalars,
 * vectors, normals, texture coordinates, tensors, and field data components.
 * This mapper assumes that the points are located on the x-y plane
 * and that the camera remains perpendicular to that plane with a y-up
 * axis (this can be constrained using vtkImageInteractor).
 * On the first render, the mapper computes the visiblility of all labels
 * at all scales, and queries this information on successive renders.
 * This causes the first render to be much slower. The visibility algorithm
 * is a greedy approach based on the point id, so the label for a point
 * will be drawn unless the label for a point with lower id overlaps it.
 *
 * @warning
 * Use this filter in combination with vtkSelectVisiblePoints if you want
 * to label only points that are visible. If you want to label cells rather
 * than points, use the filter vtkCellCenters to generate points at the
 * center of the cells. Also, you can use the class vtkIdFilter to
 * generate ids as scalars or field data, which can then be labeled.
