# The bin/make_overflow script reads in this file and creates the appropriate

# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored

# The format of this file is as follows:
#  <type>, <SIGNED|UNSIGNED>;
#
# Where <type> is a valid C type (like 'int8_t', 'hssize_t', etc. and whether
#       the type is signed or unsigned follows.
