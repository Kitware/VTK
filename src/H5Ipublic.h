 * \brief Finds the memory referred to by an ID within the given ID type such
 *        that some criterion is satisfied
 *
 * \param[in] type The identifier of the type to be searched
 * \param[in] func The function defining the search criteria
 * \param[in] key A key for the search function
 *
 * \return Returns a pointer to the object which satisfies the search function
 *         on success, NULL on failure.
 *
 * \details H5Isearch() searches through a given ID type to find an object that
 *          satisfies the criteria defined by \p func. If such an object is
 *          found, the pointer to the memory containing this object is
 *          returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned. To do this, \p func is
 *          called on every member of type \p type. The first member to satisfy
 *          \p func is returned.
 *
 *          The \p type parameter is the identifier for the ID type which is to
 *          be searched. This identifier must have been created by a call to
 *          H5Iregister_type().
 *
 *          The parameter \p func is a function pointer to a function which
 *          takes three parameters. The first parameter is a \c void* and will
 *          be a pointer to the object to be tested. This is the same object
 *          that was placed in storage using H5Iregister(). The second
 *          parameter is a hid_t and is the ID of the object to be tested. The
 *          last parameter is a \c void*. This is the \p key parameter and can
 *          be used however the user finds helpful, or it can be ignored if it
 *          is not needed. \p func returns 0 if the object it is testing does
 *          not pass its criteria. A non-zero value should be returned if the
 *          object does pass its criteria. H5I_search_func_t is defined in
 *          H5Ipublic.h and is shown below.
 *          \snippet this H5I_search_func_t_snip
 *          The \p key parameter will be passed to the search function as a
 *          parameter. It can be used to further define the search at run-time.
