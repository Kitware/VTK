/**
 * @class   vtkView
 * @brief   The superclass for all views.
 *
 *
 * vtkView is the superclass for views.  A view is generally an area of an
 * application's canvas devoted to displaying one or more VTK data objects.
 * Associated representations (subclasses of vtkDataRepresentation) are
 * responsible for converting the data into a displayable format.  These
 * representations are then added to the view.
 *
 * For views which display only one data object at a time you may set a
 * data object or pipeline connection directly on the view itself (e.g.
 * vtkGraphLayoutView, vtkLandscapeView, vtkTreeMapView).
 * The view will internally create a vtkDataRepresentation for the data.
 *
 * A view has the concept of linked selection.  If the same data is displayed
 * in multiple views, their selections may be linked by setting the same
 * vtkAnnotationLink on their representations (see vtkDataRepresentation).
