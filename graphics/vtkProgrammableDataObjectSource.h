// .NAME vtkProgrammableDataObjectSource - generate source data object via a user-specified function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProgrammableDataObjectSource is a source object that is programmable by
// the user. The output of the filter is a data object (vtkDataObject) which
// represents data via an instance of field data. To use this object, you
// must specify a function that creates the output.  
//
// Example use of this filter includes reading tabular data and encoding it
// as vtkFieldData. You can then use filters like vtkDataObjectToDataSet to
// convert the data object to a dataset and then visualize it.  Another
// important use of this class is that it allows users of interpreters (e.g.,
// Tcl or Java) the ability to write source objects without having to
// recompile C++ code or generate new libraries.
