// .NAME vtkRuledSurfaceFilter - generates a surface from a set of lines
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRuledSurfaceFilter is a filter that generates a surface from a set of
// lines. The lines are assumed to be "parallel" in the sense that they do
// not intersect and remain somewhat close to one another. A surface is
// generated by connecting the points defining each pair of lines with
// straight lines. This creates a strip for each pair of lines (i.e., a
// triangulation is created from two generating lines). The filter can handle
// an arbitrary number of lines, with lines i and i+1 assumed connected.
// Note that there are several different approaches for creating the ruled
// surface, the method for creating the surface can either use the input
// points or resample from the polylines (using a user-specified resolution).
//
// This filter offers some other important features. A DistanceFactor ivar is
// used to decide when two lines are too far apart to connect. (The factor is
// a multiple of the distance between the first two points of the two lines
// defining the strip.) If the distance between the two generating lines
// becomes too great, then the surface is not generated in that
// region. (Note: if the lines separate and then merge, then a hole can be
// generated in the surface.) In addition, the Offset and OnRation ivars can
// be used to create nifty striped surfaces. Closed surfaces (e.g., tubes) can
// be created by setting the CloseSurface ivar. (The surface can be closed
// in the other direction by repeating the first and last point in the
// polylines defining the surface.)
//
// An important use of this filter is to combine it with vtkStreamLine to
// generate stream surfaces. It can also be used to create surfaces from
// contours.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The number of lines must be greater than two if a surface is to be
// generated.  sides (i.e., a ribbon), use vtkRibbonFilter.
