// .NAME vtkLinearExtrusionFilter - sweep polygonal data creating a "skirt" from free edges and lines, and lines from vertices
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLinearExtrusionFilter is a modelling filter. It takes polygonal data as 
// input and generates polygonal data on output. The input dataset is swept
// according to some extrusion function and creates new polygonal primitives.
// These primitives form a "skirt" or swept surface. For example, sweeping a
// line results in a quadrilateral, and sweeping a triangle creates a "wedge".
//
// There are a number of control parameters for this filter. You can 
// control whether the sweep of a 2D object (i.e., polygon or triangle strip) 
// is capped with the generating geometry via the "Capping" ivar. Also, you
// can extrude in the direction of a user specified vector, towards a point,
// or in the direction of vertex normals (normals must be provided - use 
// vtkPolyNormals if necessary). The amount of extrusion is controlled by
// the "ScaleFactor" instance variable.
//
// The skirt is generated by locating certain topological features. Free 
// edges (edges of polygons or triangle strips only used by one polygon or
// triangle strips) generate surfaces. This is true also of lines or 
// polylines. Vertices generate lines.
//
// This filter can be used to create 3D fonts, 3D irregular bar charts,
// or to model 2 1/2D objects like punched plates. It also can be used to 
// create solid objects from 2D polygonal meshes.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Some polygonal objects have no free edges (e.g., sphere). When swept,
// this will result in two separate surfaces if capping is on, or no surface
// if capping is off.
