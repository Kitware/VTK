// .NAME vtkProbeFilter - sample data values at specified point locations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProbeFilter is a filter that computes point attributes (e.g., scalars,
// vectors, etc.) at specified point positions. The filter has two inputs:
// the Input and Source. The Input geometric structure is passed through the
// filter. The point attributes are computed at the Input point positions
// by interpolating into the source data. For example, we can compute data
// values on a plane (plane specified as Input) from a volume (Source).
