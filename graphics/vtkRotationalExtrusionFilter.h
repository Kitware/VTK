// .NAME vtkRotationalExtrusionFilter - sweep polygonal data creating "skirt" from free edges and lines, and lines from vertices
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRotationalExtrusionFilter is a modelling filter. It takes polygonal 
// data as input and generates polygonal data on output. The input dataset 
// is swept around the z-axis to create new polygonal primitives. These 
// primitives form a "skirt" or swept surface. For example, sweeping a
// line results in a cylindrical shell, and sweeping a circle creates a 
// torus.
//
// There are a number of control parameters for this filter. You can 
// control whether the sweep of a 2D object (i.e., polygon or triangle 
// strip) is capped with the generating geometry via the "Capping" instance
// variable. Also, you can control the angle of rotation, and whether 
// translation along the z-axis is performed along with the rotation.
// (Translation is useful for creating "springs".) You also can adjust 
// the radius of the generating geometry using the "DeltaRotation" instance 
// variable.
//
// The skirt is generated by locating certain topological features. Free 
// edges (edges of polygons or triangle strips only used by one polygon or
// triangle strips) generate surfaces. This is true also of lines or 
// polylines. Vertices generate lines.
//
// This filter can be used to model axisymmetric objects like cylinders,
// bottles, and wine glasses; or translational/rotational symmetric objects
// like springs or corkscrews.
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// If the object sweeps 360 degrees, radius does not vary, and the object 
// does not translate, capping is not performed. This is because the cap 
// is unnecessary.
//
// Some polygonal objects have no free edges (e.g., sphere). When swept,
// this will result in two separate surfaces if capping is on, or no surface
// if capping is off.
