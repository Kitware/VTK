#                         Packaging VTK for Maven
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the resources necessary to deploy the VTK Java
bindings as Maven artifacts.

To build a standard VTK package for Maven packaging use the following
CMake properties:

     CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release

     CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[destination]/mvn-staging-install

     VTK_WRAP_JAVA:BOOL=ON

To enable rendering through JOGL (i.e. vtkAbstractJoglComponent) enable
the following property:

     VTK_JAVA_JOGL_COMPONENT:BOOL=ON

Note that this will introduce a dependency on JOGL in the generated pom.xml
file.

In order to generate a custom pom.xml the user can configure those properties
within CMake otherwise decent automatically value will be set.

     MAVEN_VTK_GROUP_ID:STRING=kitware.community

     MAVEN_LOCAL_NATIVE_NAME:STRING=Win32

     MAVEN_NATIVE_ARTIFACTS:STRING=Win32;Win64;Linux32;Linux64;OSX

     MAVEN_LOCAL_REPOSITORY:STRING=${user.home}/vtk-maven-repos

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local Install
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install VTK inside your local repository execute the following
command:

  $ mvn install

The default local Maven repostiory is in `~/.m2/repository`.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local Deploy - SNAPSHOT
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some extra work may be needed in the sense that VTK is a native library that
needs to be build on each targeted platform. The idea would be to merge all
install tree from all the targeted platform and only then trigger the given
command line.

If VTK has only been build on a single computer, then the generated snapshot
will only include the native artifacts for that platform. Running the command:


  $ mvn deploy

The deployment url is defined by the property `vtk.snapshots.repo`. By default
this is set to `file://${user.home}/vtk-maven-repos/snapshots`. To deploy
to an internal artifact server (e.g. Nexus, Artifactory, etc.), you can set
this property on the command line to the deployment URL, e.g.:

  $ mvn deploy -Dvtk.snapshots.repo=http://maven.yoyodyne.com/repos/snapshots


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local Deploy - RELEASE
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Maven release process involves several steps and a certain
attention to detail to get correct. You must ensure all of the
platform native artifacts to be included in the release are available
as expencted in the pom.xml file. Remember that only one instance of a
specific release version of an artifact can ever exist. Therefore all the
necessary components must be properly assembled before going through
the release process.

The typical release process involves running:

  $ mvn release:prepare [-DdryRun=true]
  ... # respond to version info queries.
  $ mvn release:perform


It is recommended that the following resources be referenced before
performing the release process for the first time.
