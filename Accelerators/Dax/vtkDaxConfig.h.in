// Boost gives a bunch of warnings with nvcc if you don't specify how shared
// pointers should handle threads. Dax does not care (it is too careful about
// threading to cause hazards in shared pointers), but your code might. Thus,
// you should specify one when compiling with nvcc. If your code does not share
// shared pointers among threads, then you can just disable them as below.
// (BTW, if you forget to set this, Dax will give its own descriptive message
// with instructions on how to fix.)
