 * @class   vtkImplicitModeller
 * @brief   compute distance from input geometry on structured point dataset
 *
 * vtkImplicitModeller is a filter that computes the distance from the input
 * geometry to the points of an output structured point set. This distance
 * function can then be "contoured" to generate new, offset surfaces from
 * the original geometry. An important feature of this object is
 * "capping". If capping is turned on, after the implicit model is created,
 * the values on the boundary of the structured points dataset are set to
 * the cap value. This is used to force closure of the resulting contoured
 * surface. Note, however, that large cap values can generate weird surface
 * normals in those cells adjacent to the boundary of the dataset. Using
 * smaller cap value will reduce this effect.
 * <P>
 * Another important ivar is MaximumDistance. This controls how far into the
 * volume the distance function is computed from the input geometry.  Small
 * values give significant increases in performance. However, there can
 * strange sampling effects at the extreme range of the MaximumDistance.
 * <P>
 * In order to properly execute and sample the input data, a rectangular
 * region in space must be defined (this is the ivar ModelBounds).  If not
 * explicitly defined, the model bounds will be computed. Note that to avoid
 * boundary effects, it is possible to adjust the model bounds (i.e., using
 * the AdjustBounds and AdjustDistance ivars) to strictly contain the
 * sampled data.
 * <P>
 * This filter has one other unusual capability: it is possible to append
 * data in a sequence of operations to generate a single output. This is
 * useful when you have multiple datasets and want to create a
 * conglomeration of all the data.  However, the user must be careful to
 * either specify the ModelBounds or specify the first item such that its
 * bounds completely contain all other items.  This is because the
 * rectangular region of the output can not be changed after the 1st Append.
 * <P>
 * The ProcessMode ivar controls the method used within the Append function
 * (where the actual work is done regardless if the Append function is
 * explicitly called) to compute the implicit model.  If set to work in voxel
 * mode, each voxel is visited once.  If set to cell mode, each cell is visited
 * once.  Tests have shown once per voxel to be faster when there are a
 * lot of cells (at least a thousand?); relative performance improvement
 * increases with addition cells. Primitives should not be stripped for best
 * performance of the voxel mode.  Also, if explicitly using the Append feature
 * many times, the cell mode will probably be better because each voxel will be
 * visited each Append.  Append the data before input if possible when using
 * the voxel mode.  Do not switch between voxel and cell mode between execution
 * of StartAppend and EndAppend.
 * <P>
 * Further performance improvement is now possible using the PerVoxel process
 * mode on multi-processor machines (the mode is now multithreaded).  Each
 * thread processes a different "slab" of the output.  Also, if the input is
 * vtkPolyData, it is appropriately clipped for each thread; that is, each
 * thread only considers the input which could affect its slab of the output.
 * <P>
 * This filter can now produce output of any type supported by vtkImageData.
 * However to support this change, additional sqrts must be executed during the
 * Append step.  Previously, the output was initialized to the squared CapValue
 * in StartAppend, the output was updated with squared distance values during
 * the Append, and then the sqrt of the distances was computed in EndAppend.
 * To support different scalar types in the output (largely to reduce memory
 * requirements as an vtkImageShiftScale and/or vtkImageCast could have
 * achieved the same result), we can't "afford" to save squared value in the
 * output, because then we could only represent up to the sqrt of the scalar
 * max for an integer type in the output; 1 (instead of 255) for an unsigned
 * char; 11 for a char (instead of 127).  Thus this change may result in a
 * minor performance degradation.  Non-float output types can be scaled to the
 * CapValue by turning ScaleToMaximumDistance On.
