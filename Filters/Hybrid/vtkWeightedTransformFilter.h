/**
 * @class   vtkWeightedTransformFilter
 * @brief   transform based on per-point or per-cell weighting functions.
 *
 *
 * vtkWeightedTransformFilter is a filter that can be used to "skin"
 * structures and to create new and complex shapes.  Unlike a
 * traditional transform filter (which has one transform for a data
 * set) or an assembly (which has one transform per part or group of
 * parts), a weighted transform produces the weighted sum of
 * transforms on a per-point or per-cell basis.
 *
 * Each point or cell in the filter's input has an attached DataArray
 * that contains tuples of weighting functions, one per point or cell.
 * The filter also has a set of fixed transforms.  When the filter
 * executes, each input point/cell is transformed by each of the
 * transforms.  These results are weighted by the point/cell's
 * weighting factors to produce final output data.
 *
 * Linear transforms are performance-optimized.  Using arbitrary
 * transforms will work, but performance may suffer.
 *
 * As an example of the utility of weighted transforms, here's how
 * this filter can be used for "skinning."  Skinning is the process of
 * putting a mesh cover over an underlying structure, like skin over
 * bone.  Joints are difficult to skin because deformation is hard to
 * do.  Visualize skin over an elbow joint.  Part of the skin moves
 * with one bone, part of the skin moves with the other bone, and the
 * skin in the middle moves a little with each.
 *
 * Weighted filtering can be used for a simple and efficient kind of
 * skinning.  Begin with a cylindrical mesh.  Create a FloatArray with
 * two components per tuple, and one tuple for each point in the mesh.
 * Assign transform weights that linear interpolate the distance along
 * the cylinder (one component is the distance along the cylinder, the
 * other is one minus that distance).  Set the filter up to use two
 * transforms, the two used to transform the two bones.  Now, when the
 * transforms change, the mesh will deform so as to, hopefully,
 * continue to cover the bones.
 *
 * vtkWeightedTransformFilter is also useful for creating "strange and
 * complex" shapes using pinching, bending, and blending.
 *
 * @warning
 * Weighted combination of normals and vectors are probably not appropriate
 * in many cases.  Surface normals are treated somewhat specially, but
 * in many cases you may need to regenerate the surface normals.
 *
 * @warning
 * Cell data can only be transformed if all transforms are linear.
