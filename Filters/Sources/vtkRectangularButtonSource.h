/**
 * @class   vtkRectangularButtonSource
 * @brief   create a rectangular button
 *
 * vtkRectangularButtonSource creates a rectangular shaped button with
 * texture coordinates suitable for application of a texture map. This
 * provides a way to make nice looking 3D buttons. The buttons are
 * represented as vtkPolyData that includes texture coordinates and
 * normals. The button lies in the x-y plane.
 *
 * To use this class you must define its width, height and length. These
 * measurements are all taken with respect to the shoulder of the button.
 * The shoulder is defined as follows. Imagine a box sitting on the floor.
 * The distance from the floor to the top of the box is the depth; the other
 * directions are the length (x-direction) and height (y-direction). In
 * this particular widget the box can have a smaller bottom than top. The
 * ratio in size between bottom and top is called the box ratio (by
 * default=1.0). The ratio of the texture region to the shoulder region
 * is the texture ratio. And finally the texture region may be out of plane
 * compared to the shoulder. The texture height ratio controls this.
 *
 * @sa
 * vtkButtonSource vtkEllipticalButtonSource
 *
 * @warning
 * The button is defined in the x-y plane. Use vtkTransformPolyDataFilter
 * or vtkGlyph3D to orient the button in a different direction.
