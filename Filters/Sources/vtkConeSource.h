/**
 * @class   vtkConeSource
 * @brief   generate polygonal cone
 *
 * vtkConeSource creates a cone centered at a specified point and pointing in
 * a specified direction. (By default, the center is the origin and the
 * direction is the x-axis.) Depending upon the resolution of this object,
 * different representations are created. If resolution=0 a line is created;
 * if resolution=1, a single triangle is created; if resolution=2, two
 * crossed triangles are created. For resolution > 2, a 3D cone (with
 * resolution number of sides) is created. It also is possible to control
 * whether the bottom of the cone is capped with a (resolution-sided)
 * polygon, and to specify the height and radius of the cone.
