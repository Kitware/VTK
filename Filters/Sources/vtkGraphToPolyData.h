/**
 * @class   vtkGraphToPolyData
 * @brief   convert a vtkGraph to vtkPolyData
 *
 *
 * Converts a vtkGraph to a vtkPolyData.  This assumes that the points
 * of the graph have already been filled (perhaps by vtkGraphLayout),
 * and coverts all the edge of the graph into lines in the polydata.
 * The vertex data is passed along to the point data, and the edge data
 * is passed along to the cell data.
 *
 * Only the owned graph edges (i.e. edges with ghost level 0) are copied
 * into the vtkPolyData.
