 * @class   vtkExtractRectilinearGrid
 * @brief   Extract a sub grid (VOI) from the structured rectilinear dataset.
 *
 * vtkExtractRectilinearGrid rounds out the set of filters that extract
 * a subgrid out of a larger structured data set.  RIght now, this filter
 * only supports extracting a VOI.  In the future, it might support
 * strides like the vtkExtract grid filter.
