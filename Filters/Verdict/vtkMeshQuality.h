/**
 * @class   vtkMeshQuality
 * @brief   Calculate functions of quality of the elements
 *  of a mesh
 *
 *
 * vtkMeshQuality computes one or more functions of (geometric)
 * quality for each 2-D and 3-D cell (triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron,
 * or hexahedron) of a mesh. These functions of quality are then averaged
 * over the entire mesh. The minimum, average, maximum, and unbiased variance
 * of quality for each type of cell is stored in the output mesh's FieldData.
 * The FieldData arrays are named "Mesh Triangle Quality,"
 * "Mesh Quadrilateral Quality," "Mesh Tetrahedron Quality,"
 * and "Mesh Hexahedron Quality." Each array has a single tuple
 * with 5 components. The first 4 components are the quality statistics
 * mentioned above; the final value is the number of cells of the given type.
 * This final component makes aggregation of statistics for distributed
 * mesh data possible.
 *
 * By default, the per-cell quality is added to the mesh's cell data, in
 * an array named "Quality." Cell types not supported by
 * this filter will have an entry of 0. Use SaveCellQualityOff() to
 * store only the final statistics.
 *
 * This version of the filter written by Philippe Pebay and David Thompson
 * overtakes an older version written by Leila Baghdadi, Hanif Ladak, and
 * David Steinman at the Imaging Research Labs, Robarts Research Institute.
 * That version only supported tetrahedral radius ratio. See the
 * CompatibilityModeOn() member for information on how to make this filter
 * behave like the previous implementation.
 * For more information on the triangle quality functions of this class, cf.
 * Pebay & Baker 2003, Analysis of triangle quality measures, Math Comp 72:244.
 * For more information on the quadrangle quality functions of this class, cf.
 * Pebay 2004, Planar Quadrangle Quality Measures, Eng Comp 20:2.
 *
 * @warning
 * While more general than before, this class does not address many
 * cell types, including wedges and pyramids in 3D and triangle strips
 * and fans in 2D (among others).
 * Most quadrilateral quality functions are intended for planar quadrilaterals
 * only.
 * The minimal angle is not, strictly speaking, a quality function, but it is
 * provided because of its usage by many authors.
