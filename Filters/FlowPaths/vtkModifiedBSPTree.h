/**
 * @class   vtkModifiedBSPTree
 * @brief   Generate axis aligned BBox tree for raycasting and other Locator based searches
 *
 *
 * vtkModifiedBSPTree creates an evenly balanced BSP tree using a top down
 * implementation. Axis aligned split planes are found which evenly divide
 * cells into two buckets. Generally a split plane will intersect some cells
 * and these are usually stored in both child nodes of the current parent.
 * (Or split into separate cells which we cannot consider in this case).
 * Storing cells in multiple buckets creates problems associated with multiple
 * tests against rays and increases the required storage as complex meshes
 * will have many cells straddling a split plane (and further splits may
 * cause multiple copies of these).
 *
 * During a discussion with Arno Formella in 1998 he suggested using
 * a third child node to store objects which straddle split planes. I've not
 * seen this published (Yes! - see below), but thought it worth trying. This
 * implementation of the BSP tree creates a third child node for storing cells
 * laying across split planes, the third cell may overlap the other two, but the
 * two 'proper' nodes otherwise conform to usual BSP rules.
 *
 * The advantage of this implementation is cells only ever lie in one node
 * and mailbox testing is avoided. All BBoxes are axis aligned and a ray cast
 * uses an efficient search strategy based on near/far nodes and rejects
 * all BBoxes using simple tests.
 *
 * For fast raytracing, 6 copies of cell lists are stored in each leaf node
 * each list is in axis sorted order +/- x,y,z and cells are always tested
 * in the direction of the ray dominant axis. Once an intersection is found
 * any cell or BBox with a closest point further than the I-point can be
 * instantly rejected and raytracing stops as soon as no nodes can be closer
 * than the current best intersection point.
 *
 * The addition of the 'middle' node upsets the optimal balance of the tree,
 * but is a minor overhead during the raytrace. Each child node is contracted
 * such that it tightly fits all cells inside it, enabling further ray/box
 * rejections.
 *
 * This class is intended for persons requiring many ray tests and is optimized
 * for this purpose. As no cell ever lies in more than one leaf node, and parent
 * nodes do not maintain cell lists, the memory overhead of the sorted cell
 * lists is 6*num_cells*4 for 6 lists of ints, each num_cells in length.
 * The memory requirement of the nodes themselves is usually of minor
 * significance.
 *
 * Subdividision is controlled by MaxCellsPerNode - any node with more than
 * this number will be subdivided providing a good split plane can be found and
 * the max depth is not exceeded.
 *
 * The average cells per leaf will usually be around half the MaxCellsPerNode,
 * though the middle node is usually sparsely populated and lowers the average
 * slightly. The middle node will not be created when not needed.
 * Subdividing down to very small cells per node is not generally suggested
 * as then the 6 stored cell lists are effectively redundant.
 *
 * Values of MaxcellsPerNode of around 16->128 depending on dataset size will
 * usually give good results.
 *
 * Cells are only sorted into 6 lists once - before tree creation, each node
 * segments the lists and passes them down to the new child nodes whilst
 * maintaining sorted order. This makes for an efficient subdivision strategy.
 *

 *                    finding nearest ray--object intersections in ray

 *                    more or less linear in the number of objects. The basic
 *                    ideas can be characterized with a modified BSP--tree
 *                    and plane traversal. Plane traversal is a fast linear
 *                    time algorithm to find the closest intersection point
 *                    in a list of bounding volumes hit by a ray. We use
 *                    plane traversal at every node of the high outdegree
 *                    BSP--tree. Our implementation is competitive to fast
