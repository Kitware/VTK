* @class vtkFiberSurface
* @brief Given a fiber surface control polygon (FSCP) and an
* unstructured grid composed of tetrahedral cells with two scalar arrays, this filter
* computes the corresponding fiber surfaces.
*
* @section Introduction
* Fiber surfaces are constructed from sets of fibers, the multivariate analogues
* of isolines. The original paper [0] offers a general purpose method that produces
* separating surfaces representing boundaries in bivariate fields. This filter is based
* on an improvement over [0] which computes accurate and exact fiber surfaces. It can
* handle arbitrary input polygons including open polygons or self-intersecting polygons.
* The current implementation can better captures sharp features induced by polygon
* bends [1].

*
* @section Algorithm For Extracting An Exact Fiber Surface
*  Require: R.1 A 3D domain space represented by an unstructured grid composed of
*               tetrahedral cells
*           R.2 Two scalar fields, f1 and f2, that map the domain space to a 2D range
*               space. These fields are assumed to be known at vertices of the
*               unstructured grid: i.e they are two fields associated with the
*               unstructured grid.
*           R.3 A Fiber Surface Control Polygon (FSCP) defined in the range space as a
*               list of line segments (l1, l2, ..., ln). The FSCP may be an open polyline
*               or a self-intersecting polygon.
*
*   1. For each line segment l in FSCP, we ignore the endpoints of the line and assume
*      this line extends to infinity. This line will then separate the range and its
*      inverse image, i.e fiber surfaces, will also separate the domain. Based on the
*      signed distance d between the image of a cell vertex v and line l in the range,
*      v can be classified as white (d < 0), grey (d == 0) or black (d>0). The
*      interpolation parameter between two vertices v1 and v2 in a cell edge can be
*      computed as |d1| / (|d2|+|d1|), where d1 and d2 are the signed distances between
*      images of v1,v2 and line l in the range. Once the classification and interpolation
*      parameters for all vertices in a cell are known, then we can apply the Marching
*      Tetrahedra algorithm. For each tetrahedron, this produces a planar cut which we
*      refer to as a base fiber surface.
*
*   2. After generating the base fiber surface in each cell, we need a further clipping
*      process to obtain the accurate fiber surface. Clipping is based on classifying the
*      vertices of each triangle as follows:
*      Given a line segment in the fiber surface control polygon (FSCP) parameterised
*      from 0 to 1, we know that every triangle vertex in the base fiber surface belongs
*      to the fiber surface, and that the fiber through each vertex can be parameterised
*      with respect to the line segment. Therefore, we compute the parameter t for each
*      vertex and use it to classify the vertex as:
*           0: t < 0        Vertex is below the clipping range [0,1] and will be removed
*           1: 0 <= t <= 1    Vertex is inside the clipping range [0,1] and is retained
*           2: 1 < t        Vertex is above the clipping  range [0,1] and will be removed
*      Based on the classification, we can further clip the triangle to obtain the final
*      surface.
*
*   3. Repeating steps 1 and 2 for every line segment in FSCP and iterating through each
*      cell will generate the final fiber surfaces in the domain.
*
* @section VTK Filter Design
* As stated in part B (R.1), we will compute the fiber surface over an unstructured grid.
* This grid will have to be an input of the VTK filter. The two scalar fields, however,
* are assumed to be stored in the VTK unstructured grid, and will be specified using the
* SetField1() and SetField2() accessors. The FSCP will be passed into the filter as a
* second input port. The data type of FSCP is required to be a vtkPolyData, with each of
* its cell defined as a line segment and its point coordinates defined in the range of
* the bivariate fields of the input grid.
*
* @section Case Tables
* @subsection Marching tetrahedra with grey cases
* In this filter, we have added one vertex classification in Marching Tetrahedra. The
* reason is because we need a grey classification to ensure that surfaces coincident with
* the boundary of the tetrahedra will also be included in the output. Given an iso-value,
* each vertex on the tetrahedron can be classified into three types, including
* equal-(G)rey, below-(W)hite or above-(B)lack the isovalue.
* The notation of the classifications are represented as:
*     W or 0 --- below an iso-value
*     G or 1 --- equal an iso-value
*     B or 2 --- above an iso-value
* The following illustration summarises all of the surface cases (Asterisk * is used to
* highlight the outline of the triangle):

* @subsection Clipping cases of the base fiber surface
* After generating the base fiber surface in each cell, we need a further clipping
* process to obtain the accurate fiber surface. Clipping is based on classifying the
* vertices of each triangle to several cases, which will be described in this section.
* In order to keep things consistent, we assume that the vertices are ordered CCW, and
* that edges are numbered according to the opposing vertex:
*
*      v0
*     /  \
*   e2    e1
*   /      \
* v1---e0---v2
*
* =======================================================================
* There are six cases for clipping the base fiber surface (subject to the usual
* symmetries & complementarity)
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case A (No triangles): Cases 000 & 222
* Here, the entire triangle is discarded
*
* 000(A):  0

*       .     .
*      .       .

*
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case B (Point-triangle): Cases 001, 010, 100, 122, 212, 221
* One vertex is kept, and a single triangle is extracted
*
* 001(B):  1

*        /   \
*       E-----E

*
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case C (Edge Quad): Cases 011, 101, 110, 112, 121, 211
* Two vertices are kept, and a quad is extracted based on the edge
*
* 011(C):  1
*         /|\
*        / | \
*       /  |  E
*      /   | / .

*
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case D (Stripe): Cases 002, 020, 022, 200, 202, 220
* No vertices are kept, but a stripe across the middle is generated
*
* 022(D):  2
*         . .
*        .   E
*       .   /|\
*      .   / | E
*     .   /  |/ .
*    2...E---E...0
*
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case E (Point-Stripe): Cases 012, 021, 102, 120, 201, 210
* One vertex is kept, with a stripe through the triangle
*
* 021(E):  1
*         / \
*        E---E

*    2...E---E...0
*
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Case F (Entire): Case 111
* All three vertices are kept, along with the triangle
*
* 111(F):  1

* @section How to use this filter
* Suppose we have a tetrahedral mesh stored in a vtkUnstructuredGrid, we call this
* data set "inputData". This data set has two scalar arrays whose names are "f1"
* and "f2" respectively. Assume the "inputPoly" is a valid input polygon. Given
* these input above, this filter can be used as follows in c++ sample code:
*
*     vtkSmartPointer<vtkFiberSurface> fiberSurface =
*                            vtkSmartPointer<vtkFiberSurface>::New();
*     fiberSurface->SetInputData(0,inputData);
*     fiberSurface->SetInputData(1,inputPoly);
*     fiberSurface->SetField1("f1");
*     fiberSurface->SetField2("f2");
*     fiberSurface->Update();
*
* The filter output which can be called by "fiberSurface->GetOutput()", will be a
* vtkPolyData containing the output fiber surfaces.
