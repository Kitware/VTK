/**
 * @class   vtkSMPMergePoints
 * @brief   Class designed to help with merging of points in parallel
 *
 * vtkSMPMergePoints is a subclass of vtkMergePoints designed to help
 * with merging of points generated by using multiple locators in parallel.
 * Its main functionality is provided by the Merge function. It also
 * has a few additional convenience functions.
 * Merge is thread safe as long as no two threads are merging the same
 * bin. The common way of using vtkSMPMergePoints is:
 *  - Initialize with outLocator->InitializeMerge()
 *  - Allocate points with outLocator->GetPoints()->Resize(numPts) (numPts should be >= total number of points)
 *  - Do bunch of merging with outLocator->Merge(inLocator[i], ...) (this can be done in parallel as long as no two bins are done at the same time)
 *  - Fix the size of points with outLocator->FixSizeOfPointArray()
