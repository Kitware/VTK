// .NAME vtkSMPMergePoints - Class designed to help with merging of points in parallel
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSMPMergePoints is a subclass of vtkMergePoints designed to help
// with merging of points generated by using multiple locators in parallel.
// Its main functionality is provided by the Merge function. It also
// has a few additional convenience functions.
// Merge is thread safe as long as no two threads are merging the same
// bin. The common way of using vtkSMPMergePoints is:
//  - Initialize with outLocator->InitializeMerge()
//  - Allocate points with outLocator->GetPoints()->Resize(numPts) (numPts should be >= total number of points)
//  - Do bunch of merging with outLocator->Merge(inLocator[i], ...) (this can be done in parallel as long as no two bins are done at the same time)
//  - Fix the size of points with outLocator->FixSizeOfPointArray()

  // This should be called from 1 thread before any call to Merge.
  void InitializeMerge();

  // Description:
  // Merge the points of one of the bins from the given locator to
  // the same bin of the current locator. Note that this requires that
  // the two locators have identical binning structures. This also
  // merges point data given in the inPD argument to the outPd.
  // Furthermore, it generates a map of the old ids of the input locator
  // to the new ids. This is stored in the idList argument. The map
  // is idList[oldId] = newId.

  // Description:
  // At the of the merge, this can be called to set the MaxId of the
  // points array to the maximum id in the locator. The current design
  // usage is as follows:
  //  - Allocate points with points->Resize(numPts). NumPts should be >= total number of points
  //  - Do bunch of merging with outLocator->Merge(inLocator[i], ...)
  //  - Fix the size of points with outLocator->FixSizeOfPointArray()
