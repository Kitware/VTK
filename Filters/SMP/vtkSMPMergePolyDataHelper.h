 * @class   vtkSMPMergePolyDataHelper
 * @brief   Utility class for merging poly data in parallel
 * This class is designed as a utility class to help merging of poly data
 * generated by filters that generate multiple polydata outputs and the associated
 * locators. It requires that the filter uses vtkSMPMergePoints which creates
 * a number of necessary data structures.
