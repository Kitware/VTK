/**
 * @class   vtkUnsignedDistance
 * @brief   compute unsigned (i.e., non-negative) distances from an input point cloud
 *
 * vtkUnsignedDistance is a filter that computes non-negative (i.e., unsigned)
 * distances over a volume from an input point cloud. This filter is distinct
 * from vtkSignedDistance in that it does not require point normals. However,
 * isocontouring a zero-valued distance function (e.g., trying to fit a
 * surface will produce unsatisfactory results). Rather this filter, when
 * combined with an isocontouring filter such as vtkFlyingEdges3D, can
 * produce an offset, bounding surface surrounding the input point cloud.
 *
 * To use this filter, specify the input vtkPolyData (which represents the
 * point cloud); define the sampling volume; specify a radius (which limits
 * the radius of influence of each point); and set an optional point locator
 * (to accelerate proximity operations, a vtkStaticPointLocator is used by
 * default). Note that large radius values may have significant impact on
 * performance. The volume is defined by specifying dimensions in the x-y-z
 * directions, as well as a domain bounds. By default the model bounds are
 * defined from the input points, but the user can also manually specify
 * them. Finally, because the radius data member limits the influence of the
 * distance calulation, some voxels may receive no contribution. These voxel
 * values are set to the CapValue.
 *
 * This filter has one other unusual capability: it is possible to append
 * data in a sequence of operations to generate a single output. This is
 * useful when you have multiple point clouds (e.g., possibly from multiple
 * acqusition scans) and want to incrementally accumulate all the data.
 * However, the user must be careful to either specify the Bounds or
 * order the input such that the bounds of the first input completely
 * contains all other input data.  This is because the geometry and topology
 * of the output sampling volume cannot be changed after the initial Append
 * operation.
 *
 * @warning
 * Note that multiple, non-connected surfaces may be produced. For example,
 * if the point cloud is from the surface of the sphere, it is possible to
 * generate two surfaces (with isocontouring): one inside the sphere, one
 * outside the sphere. It is sometimes possible to select the surface you
 * want from the output of the contouring filter by using
 * vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
