/**
 * @class   vtkSignedDistance
 * @brief   compute signed distances from an input point cloud
 *
 * vtkSignedDistance is a filter that computes signed distances over a volume
 * from an input point cloud. The input point cloud must have point normals
 * defined, as well as an optional weighting function (e.g., probabilities
 * that the point measurements are accurate). Once the signed distance
 * function is computed, then the output volume may be isocontoured to
 * extract a approximating surface to the point cloud.
 *
 * To use this filter, specify the input vtkPolyData (which represents the
 * point cloud); define the sampling volume; specify a radius (which limits
 * the radius of influence of each point); and set an optional point locator
 * (to accelerate proximity operations, a vtkStaticPointLocator is used by
 * default). Note that large radius values may have significant impact on
 * performance. The volume is defined by specifying dimensions in the x-y-z
 * directions, as well as a domain bounds. By default the model bounds are
 * defined from the input points, but the user can also manually specify
 * them.
 *
 * This filter has one other unusual capability: it is possible to append
 * data in a sequence of operations to generate a single output. This is
 * useful when you have multiple point clouds (e.g., possibly from multiple
 * acqusition scans) and want to incrementally accumulate all the data.
 * However, the user must be careful to either specify the Bounds or
 * order the input such that the bounds of the first input completely
 * contains all other input data.  This is because the geometry and topology
 * of the output sampling volume cannot be changed after the initial Append
 * operation.
 *
 * This algorithm loosely follows the most excellent paper by Curless and
 * Levoy: "A Volumetric Method for Building Complex Models from Range
 * Images." As described in this paper it may produce a signed distance
 * volume that may contain the three data states for each voxel: near
 * surface, empty, or unseen (see vtkExtractSurface for additional
 * information). However, this algorithm has been extended to support
 * different interpolation kernels as follows.
 *
 * (Kernel description TODO including supplied weights.)
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
