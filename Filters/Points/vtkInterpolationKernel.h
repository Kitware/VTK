/**
 * @class   vtkInterpolationKernel
 * @brief   base class for interpolation kernels
 *
 *
 * vtkInterpolationKernel specifies an abstract interface for interpolation
 * kernels. An interpolation kernel is used to produce an interpolated data
 * value at a point X from the points + data in a local neighborhood
 * surrounding X. For example, given the N nearest points surrounding X, the
 * interpolation kernel provides N weights, which when combined with the N
 * data values associated with these nearest points, produces an interpolated
 * data value at point X.
 *
 * Note that various kernel initialization methods are provided. The basic
 * method requires providing a point locator to accelerate neighborhood
 * queries. Some kernels may refer back to the original dataset, or the point
 * attribute data associated with the dataset. The initialization method
 * enables different styles of initialization and is kernel-dependent.
 *
 * Typically the kernels are invoked in two parts: first, the basis is
 * computed using the supplied point locator and dataset. This basis is a
 * local footprint of point surrounding a poitnX. In this footprint are the
 * neighboring points used to compute the interpolation weights. Then, the
 * weights are computed from points forming the basis. However, advanced
 * users can develop their own basis, skipping the ComputeBasis() method, and
 * then invoke ComputeWeights() directly.
 *
 * @warning
 * The ComputeBasis() and ComputeWeights() methods must be thread safe as they
 * are used in threaded algorithms.
