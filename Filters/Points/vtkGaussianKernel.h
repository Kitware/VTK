/**
 * @class   vtkGaussianKernel
 * @brief   a spherical Gaussian interpolation kernel
 *
 *
 * vtkGaussianKernel is an interpolation kernel that simply returns the
 * weights for all points found in the sphere defined by radius R. The
 * weights are computed as: exp(-(s*r/R)^2) where r is the distance from the
 * point to be interpolated to a neighboring point within R. The sharpness s
 * simply affects the rate of fall off of the Gaussian. (A more general
 * Gaussian kernel is available from vtkEllipsoidalGaussianKernel.)
 *
 * @warning
 * The weights are normalized sp that SUM(Wi) = 1. If a neighbor point p
 * precisely lies on the point to be interpolated, then the interpolated
 * point takes on the values associated with p.
