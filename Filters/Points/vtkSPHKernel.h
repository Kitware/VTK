/**
 * @class   vtkSPHKernel
 * @brief   a family of SPH interpolation kernels
 *
 *
 * vtkSPHKernel is an abstract superclass for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
 * interpolation kernels as described by D.J. Price (see full reference
 * below).
 *
 * Note that the kernel operates over a volume in space defined by a radius
 * at a sampling point. The kernel implicitly assumes that the particles
 * making up the input data satisfies physical properties such as
 * conservation of mass. Therefore subclasses of this kernel are not
 * generally applicable for interpolation processes, and therefore operate in
 * conjunction with the vthSPHInterpolator class.
 *
 * By default the kernel computes local particle volume from the spatial step^3.
 * However, if both an optional mass and density arrays are provided then they are
 * used to compute local volume.
 *
 * Also be default, the local neighborhood around a point to be interpolated is
 * computed as the CutoffFactor * SpatialStep. (Note the CutoffFactor varies for
 * each type of SPH kernel.) However, the user may specify a CutoffArray which
 * enables variable cutoff distances per each point.
 *
 * @warning
 * For more information see D.J. Price, Smoothed particle hydrodynamics and
 * magnetohydrodynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 231:759-794, 2012. Especially
 * equation 49.
