/**
 * @class   vtkFitImplicitFunction
 * @brief   extract points on the surface of an implicit function
 *
 *
 * vtkFitImplicitFunction extract points that are on the surface of an
 * implicit function (within some threshold). Implicit functions in VTK are
 * any function of the form f(x,y,z)=c, where values c==0 are considered the
 * surface of the implicit function. Typical examples of implicit functions
 * include planes, spheres, cylinders, cones, etc. plus boolean combinations
 * of these functions. In this implementation, a threshold is used to create
 * a fuzzy region considered "on" the surface. In essence, this is a very
 * poor man's RANSAC algorithm, where the user picks a function on which to
 * fit some points. Thus it is possible to use this filter to define a
 * proposed model and place it into an optimization loop to best fit it to a
 * set of points.
 *
 * Note that while any vtkPointSet type can be provided as input, the output is
 * represented by an explicit representation of points via a
 * vtkPolyData. This output polydata will populate its instance of vtkPoints,
 * but no cells will be defined (i.e., no vtkVertex or vtkPolyVertex are
 * contained in the output). Also, after filter execution, the user can
 * request a vtkIdType* map which indicates how the input points were mapped
 * to the output. A value of map[i] (where i is the ith input point) less
 * than 0 means that the ith input point was removed. (See also the
 * superclass documentation for accessing the removed points through the
 * filter's second output.)
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
