/**
 * @class   vtkShepardKernel
 * @brief   a Shepard method interpolation kernel
 *
 *
 * vtkShepardKernel is an interpolation kernel that uses the method of
 * Shepard to perform interpolation. The weights are computed as 1/r^p, where
 * r is the distance to a neighbor point within the kernal radius R; and p
 * (the power parameter) is a positive exponent (typically p=2).
 *
 * @warning
 * The weights are normalized sp that SUM(Wi) = 1. If a neighbor point p
 * precisely lies on the point to be interpolated, then the interpolated
 * point takes on the values associated with p.
