/**
 * @class   vtkPointInterpolator2D
 * @brief   interpolate point cloud attribute data
 * onto x-y plane using various kernels
 *
 *
 * vtkPointInterpolator2D probes a point cloud Pc (the filter Source) with a
 * set of points P (the filter Input), interpolating the data values from Pc
 * onto P. Note however that the descriptive phrase "point cloud" is a
 * misnomer: Pc can be represented by any vtkDataSet type, with the points of
 * the dataset forming Pc. Similary, the output P can also be represented by
 * any vtkDataSet type; and the topology/geometry structure of P is passed
 * through to the output along with the newly interpolated arrays. However,
 * this filter presumes that P lies on a plane z=0.0, thus z-coordinates
 * are set accordingly during the interpolation process.
 *
 * The optional boolen flag InterpolateZ is provided for convenience. In
 * effect it turns the source z coordinates into an additional array that is
 * interpolated onto the output data. For example, if the source is a x-y-z
 * LIDAR point cloud, then z can be interpolated onto the output dataset as a
 * vertical elevation(z-coordinate).
 *
 * A key input to this filter is the specification of the interpolation
 * kernel, and the parameters which control the associated interpolation
 * process. Interpolation kernels include Voronoi, Gaussian, Shepard, and SPH
 * (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), with additional kernels to be added in
 * the future. See vtkPointInterpolator for more information.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
 *
 * @warning
 * For widely spaced points in Pc, or when p is located outside the bounding
 * region of Pc, the interpolation may behave badly and the interpolation
 * process will adapt as necessary to produce output. For example, if the N
 * closest points within R are requested to interpolate p, if N=0 then the
 * interpolation will switch to a different strategy (which can be controlled
 * as in the NullPointsStrategy).
