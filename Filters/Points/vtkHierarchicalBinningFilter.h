/**
 * @class   vtkHierarchicalBinningFilter
 * @brief   uniform binning of points into
 * a hierarchical structure
 *
 *
 * vtkHierarchicalBinningFilter creates a spatial, hierarchical ordering of
 * input points. This hierarchy is suitable for level-of-detail rendering, or
 * multiresolution processing. Each level of the hierarchy is based on
 * uniform binning of space, where deeper levels (and its bins) are
 * repeatedly subdivided by a given branching factor. Points are associated
 * with bins at different levels, with the number of points in each level
 * proportional to the number of bins in that level. The output points are
 * sorted according to a bin number, where the bin number is unique,
 * monotonically increasing number representing the breadth first ordering of
 * all of the levels and their bins. Thus all points in a bin (or even a level)
 * are segmented into contiguous runs.
 *
 * Note that points are associated with different bins using a pseudo random
 * process. No points are repeated, and no new points are created, thus the
 * effect of executing this filter is simply to reorder the input points.
 *
 * The algorithm proceeds as follows: Given an initial bounding box, the
 * space is uniformally subdivided into bins of (M x N x O) dimensions; in
 * turn each subsequent level in the tree is further divided into (M x N x O)
 * bins (note that level 0 is a single, root bin). Thus the number of bins at
 * level L of the hierarchical tree is: Nbins=(M^L x N^L x O^L). Once the
 * binning is created to a specified depth, then points are placed in the
 * bins using a pseudo-random sampling proportional to the number of bins in each
 * level. All input points are sorted in the order described above, with no
 * points repeated.
 *
 * The output of this filter are sorted points and associated point
 * attributes represented by a vtkPolyData. In addition, an offest integral
 * array is associated with the field data of the output, providing offsets
 * into the points list via a breadth-first traversal order. Metadata
 * describing the output is provided in the field data. Convenience functions
 * are also provided here to access the data in a particular bin or across a
 * level. (Using the offset array directly may result in higher performance.)
 *
 * While any vtkPointSet type can be provided as input, the output is
 * represented by an explicit representation of points via a
 * vtkPolyData. This output polydata will populate its instance of vtkPoints,
 * but no cells will be defined (i.e., no vtkVertex or vtkPolyVertex are
 * contained in the output).
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
