/**
 * @class   vtkPCANormalEstimation
 * @brief   generate point normals using local tangent planes
 *
 *
 * vtkPCANormalEstimation generates point normals using PCA (principal
 * component analysis).  Basically this estimates a local tangent plane
 * around each sample point p by considering a small neighborhood of points
 * around p, and fitting a plane to the neighborhood (via PCA). A good
 * introductory reference is Hoppe's "Surface reconstruction from
 * unorganized points."
 *
 * To use this filter, specify a neighborhood size. This may have to be set
 * via experimentation. In addition, the user may optionally specify a point
 * locator (instead of the default locator), which is used to accelerate
 * searches around the sample point. Finally, the user should specify how to
 * generate consistently-oriented normals. As computed by PCA, normals may
 * point in arbitrary +/- orientation, which may not be consistent with
 * neighboring normals. There are three methods to address normal
 * consistency: 1) leave the normals as computed, 2) adjust the +/- sign of
 * the normals so that the normals all point towards a specified point, and
 * 3) perform a traversal of the point cloud and flip neighboring normals so
 * that they are mutually consistent.
 *
 * The output of this filter is the same as the input except that a normal
 * per point is produced. (Note that these are unit normals.) While any
 * vtkPointSet type can be provided as input, the output is represented by an
 * explicit representation of points via a vtkPolyData. This output polydata
 * will populate its instance of vtkPoints, but no cells will be defined
 * (i.e., no vtkVertex or vtkPolyVertex are contained in the output).
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
