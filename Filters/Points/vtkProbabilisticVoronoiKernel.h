/**
 * @class   vtkProbabilisticVoronoiKernel
 * @brief   interpolate from the weighted closest point
 *
 *
 * vtkProbabilisticVoronoiKernel is an interpolation kernel that interpolates
 * from the closest weighted point from a neighborhood of points. The weights
 * refer to the probabilistic weighting that can be provided to the
 * ComputeWeights() method.
 *
 * Note that the local neighborhood is taken from the kernel footprint
 * specified in the superclass vtkGeneralizedKernel.
 *
 * @warning
 * If probability weightings are not defined, then the kernel provides the
 * same results as vtkVoronoiKernel, except a less efficiently.

   * weighting prob, and the weights array are provided by the caller of the
   * method, and may be dynamically resized as necessary. The method returns
   * the number of weights (pIds may be resized in some cases). Typically
   * this method is called after ComputeBasis(), although advanced users can
   * invoke ComputeWeights() and provide the interpolation basis points pIds
   * directly. The probably weighting prob are numbers 0<=prob<=1 which are
   * multiplied against the interpolation weights before normalization. They
   * are estimates of local confidence of weights. The prob may be NULL in
   * which all probabilities are considered =1.
