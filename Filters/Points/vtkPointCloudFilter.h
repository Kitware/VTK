/**
 * @class   vtkPointCloudFilter
 * @brief   abstract class for filtering a point cloud
 *
 *
 * vtkPointCloudFilter serves as a base for classes that filter point clouds.
 * It takes as input any vtkPointSet (which represents points explicitly
 * using vtkPoints) and produces as output an explicit representation of
 * filtered points via a vtkPolyData. This output vtkPolyData will populate
 * its instance of vtkPoints, and typically no cells will be defined (i.e.,
 * no vtkVertex or vtkPolyVertex are contained in the output unless
 * explicitly requested). Also, after filter execution, the user can request
 * a vtkIdType* point map which indicates how the input points were mapped to
 * the output. A value of PointMap[i] < 0 (where i is the ith input point)
 * means that the ith input point was removed. Otherwise PointMap[i]
 * indicates the position in the output vtkPoints array (point cloud).
 *
 * Optionally the filter may produce a second output. This second output is
 * another vtkPolyData with a vtkPoints that contains the points that were
 * removed during processing. To produce this second output, you must enable
 * GenerateOutliers. If this optional, second output is created, then the
 * contents of the PointMap are modified as well. In this case, a PointMap[i]
 * < 0 means that the ith input point has been mapped to the (-PointMap[i])-1
 * position in the second output's vtkPoints.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter copies point attributes from input to output consistent
 * with the filtering operation.
 *
 * @warning
 * It is convenient to use vtkPointGaussianMapper to render the points (since
 * this mapper does not require cells to be defined, and it is quite fast).
