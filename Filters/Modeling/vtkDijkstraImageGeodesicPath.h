/**
 * @class   vtkDijkstraImageGeodesicPath
 * @brief   Dijkstra algorithm to compute the graph geodesic.
 *
 * Takes as input a polyline and an image representing a 2D cost function
 * and performs a single source shortest path calculation.
 * Dijkstra's algorithm is used. The implementation is
 * similar to the one described in Introduction to Algorithms (Second Edition)
 * by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and
 * Cliff Stein, published by MIT Press and McGraw-Hill. Some minor
 * enhancement are added though. All vertices are not pushed on the heap
 * at start, instead a front set is maintained. The heap is implemented as
 * a binary heap. The output of the filter is a set of lines describing
 * the shortest path from StartVertex to EndVertex.  See parent class
 * vtkDijkstraGraphGeodesicPath for the implementation.
 *
 * @warning
 * The input cost image must have only VTK_PIXEL cells: i.e., a 2D image or
 * slice of a 3D volume. A cost function for a gray scale image might
 * be generated by the following pipeline:
 * vtkImageData->vtkImageGradientMagnitude->vtkImageShiftScale
 * wherein the gradient magnitude image is inverted so that strong edges
 * have low cost value.  Costs in moving from a vertex v to a vertex u
 * are calculated using a weighted additive sheme:
 * cost = Iw*f(I) + Ew*f(u,v) + Cw*f(t,u,v)
 * where Iw is the weight associated with f(I): the normalized image cost,
 * Ew is the weight associated with f(u,v): the normalized distance between
 * vertices u and v, and Cw is the weight associated with f(t,u,v):
 * the normalized curvature calculated from the vertex t which precedes
 * vertex u, and vertices u and v.  All weights range from 0 to 1.
 *
 * @par Thanks:
 * The class was contributed by Dean Inglis.
