/**
 * @class   vtkMultiThreshold
 * @brief   Threshold cells within multiple intervals
 *
 * This filter can be substituted for a chain of several vtkThreshold filters
 * and can also perform more sophisticated subsetting operations.
 * It generates a vtkMultiBlockDataSet as its output.
 * This multiblock dataset contains a vtkUnstructuredGrid for each thresholded
 * subset you request.
 * A thresholded subset can be a set defined by an interval over a
 * point or cell attribute of the mesh; these subsets are called IntervalSets.
 * A thresholded subset can also be a boolean combination of one or more IntervalSets;
 * these subsets are called BooleanSets.
 * BooleanSets allow complex logic since their output
 * can depend on multiple intervals over multiple variables
 * defined on the input mesh.
 * This is useful because it eliminates the need for thresholding several
 * times and then appending the results, as can be required with vtkThreshold
 * when one wants to remove some range of values (e.g., a notch filter).
 * Cells are not repeated when they belong to more than one interval unless
 * those intervals have different output grids.
 *
 * Another advantage this filter provides over vtkThreshold is the ability
 * to threshold on non-scalar (i.e., vector, tensor, etc.) attributes without
 * first computing an array containing some norm of the desired attribute.
 * vtkMultiThreshold provides \f$L_1\f$, \f$L_2\f$, and \f$L_{\infty}\f$ norms.
 *
 * This filter makes a distinction between intermediate subsets and
 * subsets that will be output to a grid.
 * Each intermediate subset you create with AddIntervalSet or
 * AddBooleanSet is given a unique integer identifier (via the return
 * values of these member functions).
 * If you wish for a given set to be output, you must call
 * OutputSet and pass it one of these identifiers.
 * The return of OutputSet is the integer index of the output set
 * in the multiblock dataset created by this filter.
 *
 * For example, if an input mesh defined three attributes T, P, and s, one might
 * wish to find cells that satisfy "T < 320 [K] && ( P > 101 [kPa] || s < 0.1 [kJ/kg/K] )".
 * To accomplish this with a vtkMultiThreshold filter,
 * <pre>
 * vtkMultiThreshold* thr;
 * int intervalSets[3];
 *
 * intervalSets[0] = thr->AddIntervalSet( vtkMath::NegInf(), 320., vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED, vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN,
 *     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, "T", 0, 1 );
 * intervalSets[1] = thr->AddIntervalSet( 101., vtkMath::Inf(), vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN, vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED,
 *     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_CELLS, "P", 0, 1 );
 * intervalSets[2] = thr->AddIntervalSet( vtkMath::NegInf(), 0.1, vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED, vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN,
 *     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, "s", 0, 1 );
 *
 * int intermediate = thr->AddBooleanSet( vtkMultiThreshold::OR, 2, &intervalSets[1] );
 *
 * int intersection[2];
 * intersection[0] = intervalSets[0];
 * intersection[1] = intermediate;
 * int outputSet = thr->AddBooleanSet( vtkMultiThreshold::AND, 2, intersection );
 *
 * int outputGridIndex = thr->OutputSet( outputSet );
 * thr->Update();
 * </pre>
 * The result of this filter will be a multiblock dataset that contains a single child with the desired cells.
 * If we had also called <code>thr->OutputSet( intervalSets[0] );</code>, there would be two child meshes and
 * one would contain all cells with T < 320 [K].
 * In that case, the output can be represented by this graph
 * \dot
 * digraph MultiThreshold {
 *   set0 [shape=rect,style=filled,label="point T(0) in [-Inf,320["]
 *   set1 [shape=rect,label="cell P(0) in ]101,Inf]"]
 *   set2 [shape=rect,label="point s(0) in [-Inf,0.1["]
 *   set3 [shape=rect,label="OR"]
 *   set4 [shape=rect,style=filled,label="AND"]
 *   set0 -> set4
 *   set1 -> set3
 *   set2 -> set3
 *   set3 -> set4
 * }
 * \enddot
 * The filled rectangles represent sets that are output.

   * Add a mesh subset to be computed by thresholding an attribute of the input mesh.
   * The subset can then be added to an output mesh with OuputSet() or combined with other sets using AddBooleanSet.
   * If you wish to include all cells with values below some number \a a, call
   * with xmin set to vtkMath::NegInf() and xmax set to \a a.
   * Similarly, if you wish to include all cells with values above some number \a a,
   * call with xmin set to \a a and xmax set to vtkMath::Inf().
   * When specifying Inf() or NegInf() for an endpoint, it does not matter whether
   * you specify and open or closed endpoint.

   * When creating intervals, any integers can be used for the IDs of output meshes.
   * All that matters is that the same ID be used if intervals should output to the same mesh.
   * The outputs are ordered with ascending IDs in output block 0.

   * It is possible to specify an invalid interval, in which case these routines will return -1.
   * Invalid intervals occur when
   * - an array does not exist,
   * - \a center is invalid,
   * - \a xmin == \a xmax and \a omin and/or \a omax are vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN, or
   * - \a xmin > \a xmax.
   * - \a xmin or \a xmax is not a number (i.e., IEEE NaN). Having both \a xmin and \a xmax equal NaN is allowed.
   * vtkMath provides a portable way to specify IEEE infinities and Nan.
   * Note that specifying an interval completely out of the bounds of an attribute is considered valid.
   * In fact, it is occasionally useful to create a closed interval with both endpoints set to \f$\infty\f$
   * or both endpoints set to \f$-\infty\f$ in order to locate cells with problematic values.

   * @param xmin The minimum attribute value
   * @param xmax The maximum attribute value
   * @param omin Whether the interval should be open or closed at \a xmin. Use vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN or vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED.
   * @param omax Whether the interval should be open or closed at \a xmax. Use vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN or vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED.
   * @param assoc One of vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_CELLS or vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS indicating whether
   * a point or cell array should be used.
   * @param arrayName The name of the array to use for thresholding
   * @param attribType The attribute to use for thresholding.
   * One of vtkDataSetAttributes::SCALARS, VECTORS, TENSORS, NORMALS, TCOORDS, or GLOBALIDS.
   * @param component The number of the component to threshold on or one of the following enumerants for norms:
   * LINFINITY_NORM, L2_NORM, L1_NORM.
   * @param allScalars When \a center is vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, must all scalars be in the interval for
   * the cell to be passed to the output, or just a single point's scalar?
   * @return An index used to identify the cells selected by the interval or -1 if the interval specification was invalid.
   * If a valid value is returned, you may pass it to OutputSet().
