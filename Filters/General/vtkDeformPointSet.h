/**
 * @class   vtkDeformPointSet
 * @brief   use a control polyhedron to deform an input vtkPointSet
 *
 * vtkDeformPointSet is a filter that uses a control polyhdron to deform an
 * input dataset of type vtkPointSet. The control polyhedron (or mesh) must
 * be a closed, manifold surface.
 *
 * The filter executes as follows. In initial pipeline execution, the control
 * mesh and input vtkPointSet are assumed in undeformed position, and an
 * initial set of interpolation weights are computed for each point in the
 * vtkPointSet (one interpolation weight value for each point in the control
 * mesh). The filter then stores these interpolation weights after filter
 * execution. The next time the filter executes, assuming that the number of
 * points/cells in the control mesh and vtkPointSet have not changed, the
 * points in the vtkPointSet are recomputed based on the original
 * weights. Hence if the control mesh has been deformed, it will in turn
 * cause deformation in the vtkPointSet. This can be used to animate or edit
 * the geometry of the vtkPointSet.
 *
 * @warning
 * Note that a set of interpolation weights per point in the vtkPointSet is
 * maintained. The number of interpolation weights is the number of points
 * in the control mesh. Hence keep the control mesh small in size or a n^2
 * data explostion will occur.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter maintains interpolation weights between executions (after the
 * initial execution pass computes the interpolation weights). You can
 * explicitly cause the filter to reinitialize by setting the
 * InitializeWeights boolean to true. By default, the filter will execute and
 * then set InitializeWeights to false.
 *
 * @warning
 * This work was motivated by the work of Tao Ju et al in "Mesh Value Coordinates
 * for Closed Triangular Meshes." The MVC algorithm is currently used to generate
 * interpolation weights. However, in the future this filter may be extended to
 * provide other interpolation functions.
 *
 * @warning
 * A final note: point data and cell data are passed from the input to the output.
 * Only the point coordinates of the input vtkPointSet are modified.
