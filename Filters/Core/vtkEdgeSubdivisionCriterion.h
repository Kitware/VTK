/**
 * @class   vtkEdgeSubdivisionCriterion
 * @brief   how to decide whether a linear approximation to nonlinear geometry or field should be subdivided
 *
 *
 * Descendants of this abstract class are used to decide whether a
 * piecewise linear approximation (triangles, lines, ... ) to some
 * nonlinear geometry should be subdivided. This decision may be
 * based on an absolute error metric (chord error) or on some
 * view-dependent metric (chord error compared to device resolution)
 * or on some abstract metric (color error). Or anything else, really.
 * Just so long as you implement the EvaluateEdge member, all will
 * be well.
