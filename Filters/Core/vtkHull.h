/**
 * @class   vtkHull
 * @brief   produce an n-sided convex hull
 *
 * vtkHull is a filter which will produce an n-sided convex hull given a
 * set of n planes. (The convex hull bounds the input polygonal data.)
 * The hull is generated by squeezing the planes towards the input
 * vtkPolyData, until the planes just touch the vtkPolyData. Then,
 * the resulting planes are used to generate a polyhedron (i.e., hull)
 * that is represented by triangles.
 *
 * The n planes can be defined in a number of ways including 1) manually
 * specifying each plane; 2) choosing the six face planes of the input's
 * bounding box; 3) choosing the eight vertex planes of the input's
 * bounding box; 4) choosing the twelve edge planes of the input's
 * bounding box; and/or 5) using a recursively subdivided octahedron.
 * Note that when specifying planes, the plane normals should point
 * outside of the convex region.
 *
 * The output of this filter can be used in combination with vtkLODActor
 * to represent a levels-of-detail in the LOD hierarchy. Another use of
 * this class is to manually specify the planes, and then generate the
 * polyhedron from the planes (without squeezing the planes towards the
 * input). The method GenerateHull() is used to do this.
