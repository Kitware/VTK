/**
 * @class   vtkStripper
 * @brief   create triangle strips and/or poly-lines
 *
 *
 * vtkStripper is a filter that generates triangle strips and/or poly-lines
 * from input polygons, triangle strips, and lines. Input polygons are
 * assembled into triangle strips only if they are triangles; other types of
 * polygons are passed through to the output and not stripped. (Use
 * vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate non-triangular polygons prior to running
 * this filter if you need to strip all the data.) The filter will pass
 * through (to the output) vertices if they are present in the input
 * polydata. Also note that if triangle strips or polylines are defined in
 * the input they are passed through and not joined nor extended. (If you wish
 * to strip these use vtkTriangleFilter to fragment the input into triangles
 * and lines prior to running vtkStripper.)
 *
 * The ivar MaximumLength can be used to control the maximum
 * allowable triangle strip and poly-line length.
 *
 * By default, this filter discards any cell data associated with the input.
 * Thus is because the cell structure changes and and the old cell data
 * is no longer valid. When PassCellDataAsFieldData flag is set,
 * the cell data is passed as FieldData to the output using the following rule:
 * 1) for every cell in the output that is not a triangle strip,
 *    the cell data is inserted once per cell in the output field data.
 * 2) for every triangle strip cell in the output:
 *    ii) 1 tuple is inserted for every point(j|j>=2) in the strip.
 *    This is the cell data for the cell formed by (j-2, j-1, j) in
 *    the input.
 * The field data order is same as cell data i.e. (verts,line,polys,tsrips).
 *
 * @warning
 * If triangle strips or poly-lines exist in the input data they will
 * be passed through to the output data. This filter will only construct
 * triangle strips if triangle polygons are available; and will only
 * construct poly-lines if lines are available.
