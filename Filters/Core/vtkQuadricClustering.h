 * @class   vtkQuadricClustering
 * @brief   reduce the number of triangles in a mesh
 *
 * vtkQuadricClustering is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a
 * triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry.  The
 * input to vtkQuadricClustering is a vtkPolyData object, and all types of
 * polygonal data are handled.
 *
 * The algorithm used is the one described by Peter Lindstrom in his Siggraph
 * 2000 paper, "Out-of-Core Simplification of Large Polygonal Models."  The
 * general approach of the algorithm is to cluster vertices in a uniform
 * binning of space, accumulating the quadric of each triangle (pushed out to
 * the triangles vertices) within each bin, and then determining an optimal
 * position for a single vertex in a bin by using the accumulated quadric. In
 * more detail, the algorithm first gets the bounds of the input poly data.
 * It then breaks this bounding volume into a user-specified number of
 * spatial bins.  It then reads each triangle from the input and hashes its
 * vertices into these bins.  (If this is the first time a bin has been
 * visited, initialize its quadric to the 0 matrix.) The algorithm computes
 * the error quadric for this triangle and adds it to the existing quadric of
 * the bin in which each vertex is contained. Then, if 2 or more vertices of
 * the triangle fall in the same bin, the triangle is dicarded.  If the
 * triangle is not discarded, it adds the triangle to the list of output
 * triangles as a list of vertex identifiers.  (There is one vertex id per
 * bin.)  After all the triangles have been read, the representative vertex
 * for each bin is computed (an optimal location is found) using the quadric
 * for that bin.  This determines the spatial location of the vertices of
 * each of the triangles in the output.
 *
 * To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial subdivision
 * in the x, y, and z directions. You must also specify an input vtkPolyData.
 * Then choose to either 1) use the original points that minimize the quadric
 * error to produce the output triangles or 2) compute an optimal position in
 * each bin to produce the output triangles (recommended and default behavior).
 *
 * This filter can take multiple inputs.  To do this, the user must explicity
 * call StartAppend, Append (once for each input), and EndAppend.  StartAppend
 * sets up the data structure to hold the quadric matrices.  Append processes
 * each triangle in the input poly data it was called on, hashes its vertices
 * to the appropriate bins, determines whether to keep this triangle, and
 * updates the appropriate quadric matrices.  EndAppend determines the spatial
 * location of each of the representative vertices for the visited bins. While
 * this approach does not fit into the visualization architecture and requires
 * manual control, it has the advantage that extremely large data can be
 * processed in pieces and appended to the filter piece-by-piece.
 *
 * @warning
 * This filter can drastically affect topology, i.e., topology is not
 * preserved.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter handles input triangle strips and arbitrary polygons. Arbitrary
 * polygons are assumed convex: during insertion they are triangulated using
 * a fan of triangles from the first point in the polygons. If the polygon is
 * concave, this can produce bad results. In this case, use vtkTriangleFilter
 * to triangulate the polygons first.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter also treats polylines and vertices.
 *
 * @warning
 * Note that for certain types of geometry (e.g., a mostly 2D plane with
 * jitter in the normal direction), the decimator can perform badly. In this
 * sitation, set the number of bins in the normal direction to one.
