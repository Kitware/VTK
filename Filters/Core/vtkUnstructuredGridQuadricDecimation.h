/**
 * @class   vtkUnstructuredGridQuadricDecimation
 * @brief   reduce the number of
 * tetrahedra in a mesh
 *
 *
 *
 * vtkUnstructuredGridQuadricDecimation is a class that simplifies
 * tetrahedral meshes using randomized multiple choice edge
 * collapses. The input to this filter is a vtkUnstructuredGrid object
 * with a single scalar field (specifying in the ScalarsName
 * attribute). Users can determine the size of the output mesh by
 * either setting the value of TargetReduction or
 * NumberOfTetsOutput. The BoundaryWeight can be set to control how
 * well the mesh boundary should be preserved. The implementation uses
 * Michael Garland's generalized Quadric Error Metrics, the Corner
 * Table representation and the Standard Conjugate Gradient Method to
 * order the edge collapse sequence.
 *
 * Instead of using the traditional priority queue, the algorithm uses
 * a randomized approach to yield faster performance with comparable
 * quality. At each step, a set of 8 random candidate edges are
 * examined to select the best edge to collapse. This number can also
 * be changed by users through NumberOfCandidates.
 *
 * For more information as well as the streaming version of this
 * algorithm see:
 *
 * "Streaming Simplification of Tetrahedral Meshes" by H. T. Vo,
 * S. P. Callahan, P. Lindstrom, V. Pascucci and C. T. Silva, IEEE
 * Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 13(1):145-155,
 * 2007.
