r"""
    This module provides some testing functionality for paraview and
    vtk web applications.  It provides the ability to run an arbitrary
    test script in a separate thread and communicate the results back
    to the service so that the CTest framework can be notified of the
    success or failure of the test.

    This test harness will notice when the test script has finished
    running and will notify the service to stop.  At this point, the
    test results will be checked in the main thread which ran the
    service, and in the case of failure an exeception will be raised
    to notify CTest of the failure.

    Test scripts need to follow some simple rules in order to work
    within the test harness framework:

    1) implement a function called "runTest(args)", where the args
    parameter contains all the arguments given to the web application
    upon starting.  Among other important items, args will contain the
    port number where the web application is listening.

    2) import the testing module so that the script has access to
    the functions which indicate success and failure.  Also the
    testing module contains convenience functions that might be of
    use to the test scripts.

       from vtk.web import testing

    3) Call the "testPass(testName)" or "testFail(testName)" functions
    from within the runTest(args) function to indicate to the framework
    whether the test passed or failed.
