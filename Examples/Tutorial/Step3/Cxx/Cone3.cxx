//
// This example demonstrates how to use multiple renderers within a
// render window. It is a variation of the Cone.cxx example. Please
// refer to that example for additional documentation.
//

// First include the required header files for the VTK classes we are using.
#include "vtkConeSource.h"
#include "vtkPolyDataMapper.h"
#include "vtkRenderWindow.h"
#include "vtkCamera.h"
#include "vtkActor.h"
#include "vtkRenderer.h"

int main()
{
  //
  // Next we create an instance of vtkConeSource and set some of its
  // properties. The instance of vtkConeSource "cone" is part of a
  // visualization pipeline (it is a source process object); it produces data
  // (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.
  //
  vtkConeSource *cone = vtkConeSource::New();
  cone->SetHeight( 3.0 );
  cone->SetRadius( 1.0 );
  cone->SetResolution( 10 );

  //
  // In this example we terminate the pipeline with a mapper process object.
  // (Intermediate filters such as vtkShrinkPolyData could be inserted in
  // between the source and the mapper.)  We create an instance of
  // vtkPolyDataMapper to map the polygonal data into graphics primitives. We
  // connect the output of the cone souece to the input of this mapper.
  //
  vtkPolyDataMapper *coneMapper = vtkPolyDataMapper::New();
  coneMapper->SetInputConnection( cone->GetOutputPort() );

  //
  // Create an actor to represent the cone. The actor orchestrates rendering
  // of the mapper's graphics primitives. An actor also refers to properties
  // via a vtkProperty instance, and includes an internal transformation
  // matrix. We set this actor's mapper to be coneMapper which we created
  // above.
  //
  vtkActor *coneActor = vtkActor::New();
  coneActor->SetMapper( coneMapper );

  //
  // Create two renderers and assign actors to them. A renderer renders into
  // a viewport within the vtkRenderWindow. It is part or all of a window on
  // the screen and it is responsible for drawing the actors it has.  We also
  // set the background color here. In this example we are adding the same
  // actor to two different renderers; it is okay to add different actors to
  // different renderers as well.
  //
  vtkRenderer *ren1= vtkRenderer::New();
  ren1->AddActor( coneActor );
  ren1->SetBackground( 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 );
  ren1->SetViewport(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0);

  vtkRenderer *ren2= vtkRenderer::New();
  ren2->AddActor( coneActor );
  ren2->SetBackground( 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 );
  ren2->SetViewport(0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);

  //
  // Finally we create the render window which will show up on the screen.
  // We put our renderer into the render window using AddRenderer. We also
  // set the size to be 300 pixels by 300.
  //
  vtkRenderWindow *renWin = vtkRenderWindow::New();
  renWin->AddRenderer( ren1 );
  renWin->AddRenderer( ren2 );
  renWin->SetSize( 600, 300 );

  //
  // Make one view 90 degrees from other.
  //
  ren1->ResetCamera();
  ren1->GetActiveCamera()->Azimuth(90);

  //
  // Now we loop over 360 degreeees and render the cone each time.
  //
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 360; ++i)
  {
    // render the image
    renWin->Render();
    // rotate the active camera by one degree
    ren1->GetActiveCamera()->Azimuth( 1 );
    ren2->GetActiveCamera()->Azimuth( 1 );
  }

  //
  // Free up any objects we created. All instances in VTK are deleted by
  // using the Delete() method.
  //
  cone->Delete();
  coneMapper->Delete();
  coneActor->Delete();
  ren1->Delete();
  ren2->Delete();
  renWin->Delete();

  return 0;
}
