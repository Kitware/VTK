Introduction:
-------------

This directory provides a starting point to create a local project
that adds classes to VTK.  It is intended to enable users to put a few
of their own classes into a new local kit.  The classes are
automatically wrapped into the same languages into which your VTK
build is wrapped.

What you should do:
-------------------

- Copy this vtkLocal directory to a different out-of-source place, and
  remove all CVS subdirs to avoid any accidental commit to the main
  VTK CVS.

- Edit the CMakeLists.txt file and add your classes to the vtkLocal_SRCS
  list.  Also add any VTK kits used by your classes to the vtkLocal_LIBS
  list.  You can also change the project name, but "vtkLocal" is fine
  for most users unless you wish to distribute the library.
  Your classes should #include "vtkLocalConfigure.h", or
  "<project-name>Configure.h" if you changed the project name.  They
  should also be declared as "class VTK_vtkLocal_EXPORT vtkMyClass"
  or "class VTK_<project-name>_EXPORT vtkMyClass" if you changed the project
  name.

- Run CMake as usual.  Use your copy of the vtkLocal directory as the
  source dir, and choose whatever build directory you prefer.
  If it is not found automatically, set VTK_DIR in the CMake GUI
  to point to the VTK build tree, or to the install tree in PREFIX/lib/vtk.

- Build your project.

- If you want to use your classes from another C++ project and are
  building with shared libraries on windows, add the path to your
  build-dir/bin directory to your PATH environment variable so the
  DLL can be found (with the Debug, Release, etc. directory name for
  Visual Studio builds).

- If you want to use your classes from Tcl, add your project build tree
  to the TCLLIBPATH (with the Debug, Release, etc. directory name for
  Visual Studio builds).  You may load your classes by using
  "package require vtkLocalTCL" or "package require <project-name>TCL"
  if you changed the project name.  Windows users should use forward
  slashes (/) instead of the usual backward slashes (\), and should
  surround the path by quotes (") if it contains any space.  Remember
  that TCLLIBPATH is a space-separated list.
