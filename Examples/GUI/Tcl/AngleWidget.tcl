# VTK widgets consist of two parts: the widget part that handles event processing;
# and the widget representation that defines how the widget appears in the scene
# (i.e., matters pertaining to geometry).  The angle 2D representation consists
# of a pair of rays emanating from a common center point with an arc between
# the rays.  Text actors representing the length of the rays and the angle in
# degrees are placed midway along the various lines and updated in real time as
# the positions of the widget's handles changes.
