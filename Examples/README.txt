VTK Examples Directory
----------------------
The following directory contains many well-commented examples showing how to
use VTK. Examples are available in the C++, Python and Java programming
languages. In no way should these examples be considered comprehensive; VTK
is a large system, we have tried to pick examples that demonstrate key
features.


Table Of Contents
-----------------
A brief table of contents of the contents of this directory follows.
Beginners should start with the examples found in the Tutorial subdirectory.
The topics listed here have corresponding subdirectories in VTK/Examples.
